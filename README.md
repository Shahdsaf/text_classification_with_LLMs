# kapa_question_type_classification


## Task 1: creating a classifier of questions 

Since we have enough data (1000+), we can simply do full finetuning of a suitable encoder-only LLM with a randomly initialized classification layer to learn the classification task.

### Data prep

EDA, Split and save into separate dfs.


### Model 
which model?

### Experiments

tune hparams
add answer or not?
different models maybe?
augmentation?
