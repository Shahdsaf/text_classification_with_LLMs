      "question": "Build Error\nWhen I try to import an image statically and use the `Image` component, I keep getting a build error",
      "answer": "Next.js handles static image imports slightly differently than some other frameworks. When you import an image in Next.js, it returns an object rather than a string. This object can then be used directly with the Next.js `<Image>` component, or you can use the object's `src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nHere's an example of how you might import an image and use it in your component:\n\n```jsx\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n\n// Then in your component\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nIf you're still having issues, it's possible that there's a conflict with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently. In this case, you can disable static image imports in your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n images: {\n disableStaticImages: true,\n },\n}\n```\n\nThis will disable the default behavior of Next.js static image imports, which might resolve the conflict.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, could you provide more details about the error message you're seeing? That could help in diagnosing the issue.\n\nSources:\n- [Next.js Docs: Migrating from Create React App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app#step-8-update-static-image-imports)\n- [Next.js Docs: Disable Static Images](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#disablestaticimages)"

      "answer": "I'm sorry, but based on the provided knowledge sources, there is no direct information on how to specify a custom character to separate nodes/chunks in LlamaIndex. The available information suggests that LlamaIndex uses predefined text splitters like `SentenceSplitter` and `TokenTextSplitter` to split documents into nodes or chunks. \n\nFor example, the `SentenceSplitter` is used in the following way:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter\n\nSettings.text_splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=20)\n```\n(Source: [Node Parser Usage Pattern](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/root.html))\n\nAnd the `TokenTextSplitter` is used like this:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import TokenTextSplitter\n\npipeline = IngestionPipeline(transformations=[TokenTextSplitter(), ...])\nnodes = pipeline.run(documents=documents)\n```\n(Source: [Lower-Level Transformation API](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/understanding/loading/loading.html))\n\nHowever, these splitters do not seem to accept a custom character as a parameter. For more specific customization, you may need to refer to the LlamaIndex documentation or source code, or consider implementing a custom splitter."

      "answer": "Yes, in Mage, you can define global variables that can be used by every block in a pipeline. These are known as Runtime Variables. They are useful for storing constants shared by multiple blocks or constants whose value is determined at pipeline runtime. You can use runtime variables to pass information between blocks in a pipeline. However, the documentation does not specify if these variables can be set via an API. \n\nHere is the relevant documentation for [Runtime Variables](https://docs.mage.ai/development/variables/overview#runtime-variables).\n\nIn addition to Runtime Variables, Mage also supports Block Variables. These are variables scoped at the block-level, meaning they are accessible in a specific block but not other blocks in the same pipeline. Block variables are not accessible by other pipelines that use the same block. You can create or edit block variables by going to a pipeline’s `metadata.yaml` file and adding them to a block’s `configuration` property. \n\nHere is the relevant documentation for [Block Variables](https://docs.mage.ai/development/variables/block-variables).\n\nIf you need a variable that is common to all pipelines, you might want to consider using environment variables. These are set in the container/instance, not for a specific pipeline. In Python, you can access them using `os.getenv('key')`. In SQL or YAML, you can use `{{ env_var() }}`.\n\nHere is the relevant documentation for [Environment Variables](https://docs.mage.ai/development/variables/overview#environment-variables)."

You can generate this token from the Settings page of the Samsara Dashboard. Navigate to Samsara Dashboard -> Settings -> API Tokens and click \"Add an API Token\". You can select which Tags to limit the API token to and you can select which Scopes the API token should have (e.g. Routes, Compliance, Addresses, Drivers, Vehicles). Learn more about scopes in the [Authentication developer guide](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/authentication).\n\n2. Use the API token in your HTTP request: Samsara uses the Bearer Token HTTP authentication scheme. Include the authentication token in the `Authorization` header in your HTTP request. Here is an example using cURL:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET 'https://api.samsara.com/fleet/vehicles' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer <<token>>'\n```\nReplace `<<token>>` with your API token.\n\n3. Handle the response: The Samsara API returns JSON-encoded responses. You can process this response according to your application's needs.\n\nPlease note that all API requests to Samsara must use `https` (not `http`) and use TLS protocol version 1.2 or above. Also, your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure.

      "answer": "EventStoreDB provides a Python client library that allows developers to work with subscriptions in an asynchronous manner. This is particularly useful when you want to process events as they are appended to the stream.\n\nHere is an example of how you can subscribe to a stream and process events asynchronously in Python:\n\n```python\nsubscription = client.subscribe_to_stream(\n    stream_name=\"$et-MyEventType\",\n    stream_position=0,\n    resolve_links=True,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `subscribe_to_stream` method is used to create a subscription to a stream. The `stream_name` parameter specifies the name of the stream to subscribe to, the `stream_position` parameter specifies the position in the stream to start the subscription from, and the `resolve_links` parameter specifies whether to resolve link-to events or not.\n\nYou can also use server-side filtering when subscribing to the `$all` stream to only receive the events that you care about. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nclient.subscribe_to_all(\n    filter_include=[r\"test-\\w+\"],\n    filter_by_stream_name=True,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `subscribe_to_all` method is used to create a subscription to the `$all` stream. The `filter_include` parameter is used to specify a regular expression that matches the names of the streams to include in the subscription, and the `filter_by_stream_name` parameter is used to indicate that the filtering should be done by stream name.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [EventStoreDB documentation](https://developers.eventstore.com/clients/grpc/subscriptions.html#server-side-filtering) and the [Python client library blog post](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/python_client_library)."

However, it's important to note that when you assign an apex domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a `www` subdomain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`) as the primary domain for your site, Netlify automatically adds two entries to the Production domains panel: one for the apex domain, and one for the `www` subdomain. \n\nIf you set the `www` subdomain as your primary domain, Netlify will automatically redirect the apex domain to the `www` subdomain. If you set the apex domain as your primary domain, Netlify will automatically redirect the `www` subdomain to the apex domain. \n\nIf you're using external DNS, Netlify strongly recommends setting the `www` subdomain (or another subdomain) as your primary domain. If you want to set an apex domain as your primary domain, it's recommended to use Netlify DNS. \n\nTo change this setting, you would need to go to your site settings in Netlify, navigate to Domain management, and adjust your primary domain setting. \n\nPlease note that Netlify doesn't automatically redirect for any other subdomains. You can configure this behavior yourself with domain-level redirects. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Netlify documentation on domain management](https://docs.netlify.com/create/domain-management#_1-create-dns-records) and [redirect options](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#domain-level-redirects)."

If a blendshape is activating without any toggle when entering play mode, it's likely that there's an animation or script that's causing this behavior.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Check the animations**: Look for any animations that might be affecting the blendshape.

If you find one, you can modify or remove the code that's causing the blendshape to activate.\n\n3. **Check the blendshape settings in the Skinned Mesh Renderer**: If the blendshape is set to a value other than 0 in the Skinned Mesh Renderer, it will activate when you enter play mode. You can reset it to 0 to prevent this.\n\nIf you're working with VRChat avatars, you should also be aware that VRChat uses the Oculus Audio library to detect and set visemes (mouth shapes for speaking), which are controlled by blendshapes. If the blendshape that's activating is a viseme, you might need to adjust your avatar's viseme settings in VRChat. You can find more information about this in the [VRChat creator documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/creating-your-first-avatar#viseme-blend-shape-recommended).\n\nAlso, if you're using the VRChat SDK, you should be aware that blendshape animations should generally be placed in the FX layer. This is because blendshape animations aren't copied to your avatar's mirror clone in other layers.

      "question": "how do I stake my hedera tokens form my okx wallet and how does it work? period of staking, rewards .. etc.",
      "answer": "Staking your Hedera tokens involves associating your HBAR balance to a node in the Hedera network. This process contributes to the security of the network and allows you to earn rewards in HBAR. Here's a general overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Choose a Node or Account to Stake to:** An account can stake its HBAR to a node in the Hedera network or to another account. This is known as indirect staking. The full balance of the account is staked to the node or the specified account. \n\n2. **No Lock-up Period:** There is no lock-up period when accounts are staked to a node. The staked account balance is liquid at all times, meaning you can transfer HBAR tokens in and out of the account, and your account will continue to be staked to the node without disruption.\n\n3. **Minimum Staking Period:** The minimum staking period is one day (24 hours). The staking period begins at midnight UTC and ends at midnight UTC. Accounts staked for less than the defined minimum staking period are not eligible to earn rewards for that period.\n\n4. **Staking Rewards:** The staking reward rate is determined by the Hedera Governing Council and updated on the mainnet. Staking rewards do not expire but can only be collected for up to 365 days without a rewards payment being triggered. If more than 365 days pass without a rewards payment, rewards can only be collected for the latest 365 days periods.\n\nAs for staking from your OKX wallet, the specific process may vary depending on the wallet's interface and features. You may need to transfer your HBAR tokens from your OKX wallet to a wallet that supports Hedera staking. I recommend checking with OKX or the wallet provider for specific instructions.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Hedera Staking Documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/staking/staking) and the [Hedera Account Properties Documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/accounts/account-properties#keys)."

      "question": "New to docker ",
      "answer": "Welcome to the world of Docker! Docker is a platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. \n\nIf you're planning to use Portainer to manage your Docker environment, here's how you can get started:\n\n1. Install Docker: You need to have the latest version of Docker installed and working on your machine. \n\n2. Install Portainer: Depending on whether you're using the Business Edition or the Community Edition of Portainer, you can follow the respective guides. For Business Edition users, start with the [Install Guide](https://install.portainer.io). For Community Edition users, refer to the [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.portainer.io).\n\n3. Understand Portainer: Portainer consists of two elements, the Portainer Server, and the Portainer Agent. Both elements run as lightweight Docker containers on a Docker engine.\n\n4. Access Portainer: By default, Portainer Server will expose the UI over port `9443` and expose a TCP tunnel server over port `8000`. The latter is optional and is only required if you plan to use the Edge compute features with Edge agents.\n\n5. Learn more: Portainer provides a range of [tutorials](https://www.portainer.io/portainer-tutorials) and [self-paced courses](https://www.portainer.io/academy) to help you get started and learn more about deploying and managing your applications with Docker and Portainer.\n\nRemember, your environment should meet Portainer's [requirements](https://docs.portainer.io/start/requirements-and-prerequisites). While Portainer may work with other configurations, it may require configuration changes or have limited functionality. \n\nHappy Dockering!"

      "question": "Authorization Header Apisause/axios\nI want to send an authorization header every time I make a request to an API with axios or apisause with nextjs App Router.",
      "answer": "Based on the provided knowledge sources, there isn't a direct example of setting an authorization header with axios or apisause in a Next.js App Router. However, you can set headers for a specific Route Handler or API route in Next.js. \n\nHere's an example of how you can set headers in a Next.js API route:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n req: NextApiRequest,\n res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n const session = await getSession(req)\n \n // Check if the user is authenticated\n if (!session) {\n res.status(401).json({\n error: 'User is not authenticated',\n })\n return\n }\n \n // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n res.status(401).json({\n error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n })\n return\n }\n \n // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n // ... implementation of the API Route\n}\n```\n[Source](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#protecting-api-routes)\n\nFor axios or apisause, you would typically set the authorization header in the request configuration. However, the exact implementation would depend on the specifics of your application and the libraries you're using.\n\nFor more information on handling authentication in Next.js, you can refer to the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication)."

      "question": "how do I set default font colors?",
      "answer": "To set default font colors in NextUI, you can use the `text-foreground` class in your root element. This class sets the text color according to the chosen theme. Here's an example of how you can apply this in your `main.jsx` or `main.tsx`:\n\n```jsx\n// main.tsx or main.jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\nimport {NextUIProvider} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <NextUIProvider>\n      <main className=\"dark text-foreground bg-background\">\n        <App />\n      </main>\n    </NextUIProvider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `dark` class sets the theme to dark, `text-foreground` sets the text color, and `bg-background` sets the background color. You can replace `dark` with `light` to use the light theme.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [NextUI Theme Setup documentation](https://nextui.org/docs/customization/theme#setup)."

      "question": "can I access in the repharesing prompt to a slot and how?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can access the value of a slot in Rasa. Slots in Rasa are part of the bot's memory and they store pieces of information that your assistant needs to refer to later. They can direct the flow of the conversation based on `slot_was_set` events. \n\nTo access a slot value, you can use the `tracker.get_slot(slotname)` method in a custom action. Here's an example from a forum post:\n\n```python\ntracker.get_slot('slotname')\n```\n\nThis will return the value of the slot named 'slotname'. \n\nYou can also use slots in your responses by including the slot name in curly braces `{}` in your response templates. For example, if you have a slot named `recipient`, you can use it in a response like this:\n\n```yaml\nresponses:\n  utter_ask_recipient:\n  - text: \"Who would you like to send money to, {recipient}?\"\n```\n\nIn this case, `{recipient}` will be replaced by the value of the `recipient` slot when the response is sent.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Slots](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/domain#slots)\n- [Custom Actions](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server/sdk-actions)\n- [Tracker](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server/sdk-tracker)\n- [Responses](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/responses)"

For teams without sites, a deploy dropzone will also appear in **Team overview** ([source](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys#drag-and-drop)).\n\n2. **Update an existing site**: If you need to update a site that you created using drag and drop, update and rebuild your project locally. Then, drag the project’s updated output folder to the deploy dropzone at the bottom of the site’s **Deploys** page. This will start a new site deploy with the updated files ([source](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys#drag-and-drop)).\n\n3. **Deploy local files**: If you have an existing project on your local machine that isn’t linked to a Git repository, you can manually deploy your site by using Netlify’s deploy dropzone. Go to your team’s **Sites** page, open the **Add new site** menu, and select **Deploy manually**. Drag and drop your site’s output folder to the deploy dropzone to deploy your site ([source](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site#deploy-local-files)).\n\nPlease note that the `index.html` must reside at the root of the directory/repository you are deploying. It cannot reside in a subdirectory ([source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/114813)).\n\nAlso, keep in mind that manual deploys do not generate deploy logs as they don’t actually build anything. Therefore, if your deploy gets stuck, you won't be able to see what's happening. To avoid this, ensure your deploys are under 50MB, individual files are not over 10MB, you have an index.html in the root of your project, all of your project assets are in a folder, and you're using a reliable network connection and a computer with sufficient free memory ([source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/112))."

      "question": "How do you add a customer POI within studio and during runtime within your iOS app?",
      "answer": "To add a custom Point of Interest (POI) within your iOS app during runtime, you can use the Mapbox Vision SDK. The process involves preparing POI data to be added to the screen. To draw a POI label on the screen, you need to take the geo coordinate (longitude, latitude) of the POI and make two coordinate transformations: first from geo coordinates to world coordinates, then from world coordinates to frame coordinates. The final step is to construct the marker view frame, set it, and display the view. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this in the [Mapbox documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/ios-vision-poi-drawing#calculate-poi-positions).\n\nAs for adding a custom POI within Mapbox Studio, you can create a custom map style. This involves uploading data, building styles from scratch, and styling groups of layers together using style components. Once you've created your custom style, you can publish it and load it into your application. If you update the underlying data or you edit and publish updates to the style in Mapbox Studio, those changes will be reflected in your application. More information on this can be found in the [Mapbox documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/dive-deeper/map-design#tools-for-making-a-map).\n\nRemember, these approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can load a custom style and update map features from that custom style in your application at runtime."

      "answer": "When the `getUserMedia()` function is provided with either invalid or empty constraints, Daily will emit a `camera-error` event with the `error.type` value set to `\"constraints\"`. The `reason` field in the error object will specify whether the constraints were invalid or empty. Here's an example of what the error object might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"camera-error\",\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"constraints\",\n    \"msg\": \"Invalid constraints provided.\",\n    \"reason\": \"invalid\"\n  },\n  \"errorMsg\": {\n    \"errorMsg\": \"camera/mic error\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, you should display a message to your client indicating that there was an error with the constraints provided to the `getUserMedia()` function. The exact wording of the message will depend on the `reason` field in the error object. For example, if the `reason` is `\"invalid\"`, you might display a message like \"Invalid constraints provided for camera/microphone access. Please check your settings and try again.\"\n\nRemember to handle these errors in a way that is informative and helpful to your client. You can refer to the [Daily documentation](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events) for more information on handling `camera-error` events."

      "answer": "There could be several reasons why your pipeline is not running. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. Verify if the actor who is set for the scheduled pipelines is still part of the organization. You can find this setting under **Attribution** in the **Triggers** section of the web app.\n\n2. Check if the branch set for the schedule has been deleted.\n\n3. If your VCS organization is using SAML protection, be aware that SAML tokens expire often, which can cause requests to fail.\n\n4. Check the individual job and workflow views for error messages in the CircleCI application. More often than not, the error is because of formatting errors in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. You can refer to the [YAML Introduction](https://circleci.com/docs/introduction-to-yaml-configurations/) page for more details.\n\n5. If your jobs are queuing often, it could be due to a concurrency limit being imposed due to your organization’s plan. You might want to consider [upgrading your plan](https://circleci.com/pricing).\n\n6. If you are experiencing queuing on your jobs even though you are on the Performance plan, it is possible you are hitting the soft concurrency limits implemented by CircleCI to keep the system stable for all customers. You can [contact CircleCI support](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to request raises on these limits.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve your issue, it's possible that your account has been flagged due to CircleCI's checks to prevent misuse of its free resources.

      "answer": "SuperGradients supports transfer learning, which is a technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new dataset. This can be particularly effective when not a lot of data is available for training, allowing you to take advantage of knowledge gained from other sources.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use SuperGradients for transfer learning:\n\n1. **Experiment Setup:** Initialize the `Trainer` which handles model training, evaluating test data, making predictions, and managing checkpoints. You need to provide an experiment name and a directory for saving checkpoints, logs, and tensorboards.\n\n```python\nfrom super_gradients import Trainer\n\nexperiment_name = \"resnet18_cifar10_example\"\nCHECKPOINT_DIR = '/path/to/checkpoints/root/dir'\n\ntrainer = Trainer(experiment_name=experiment_name, ckpt_root_dir=CHECKPOINT_DIR)\n```\n[Source](https://docs.deci.ai/super-gradients/latest/documentation/source/Example_Classification.html#training-a-classification-model-and-transfer-learning)\n\n2. **Model Initialization:** Initialize your model with pre-trained weights provided by SuperGradients. For example, to initialize a ResNet18 model with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nmodel = models.get(model_name=Models.RESNET18, num_classes=10, pretrained_weights=\"imagenet\")\n```\n[Source](https://docs.deci.ai/super-gradients/latest/documentation/source/Example_Classification.html#5c-transfer-learning)\n\n3. **Training:** After setting up the experiment and initializing the model, you can proceed with training and evaluation. SuperGradients also provides a variety of training parameters optimized per dataset and architecture, which you can find in the [SuperGradients recipes](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/tree/master/src/super_gradients/recipes).\n[Source](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/tutorials/DagsHub_X_SuperGradients.ipynb)\n\nRemember to install the SuperGradients library before starting:\n\n```python\npip install super-gradients\n```\n[Source](https://docs.deci.ai/super-gradients/latest/documentation/source/Example_Classification.html#training-a-classification-model-and-transfer-learning)\n\nFor a more detailed example of transfer learning with SuperGradients, you can refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/notebooks/transfer_learning_semantic_segmentation.ipynb) which demonstrates how to use a pre-trained model and a custom dataset to improve the model's accuracy using transfer learning for semantic segmentation."

      "question": "How do I design a DHIS2 database?",
      "answer": "Designing a DHIS2 database involves several steps and requires a good understanding of the processes which you are trying to collect data from. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Set up an organisational hierarchy\n2. Define data elements\n3. Define data sets and data entry forms\n4. Define validation rules\n5. Define indicators\n6. Define report tables and design reports\n7. Set up the GIS module\n8. Design charts and customise the dashboard\n\nThe first step in designing a DHIS2 database is to create meta-data. Meta-data, or data about the data, describes what should be collected (data elements and categories), where it should be collected (organisation units) and how frequently it should be collected (periods). This meta-data needs to be created in the DHIS2 database before it can be used. This can be done through the user interface and requires no programming or in-depth technical skills of the software.\n\nThe Data Element is perhaps the most important building block of a DHIS2 database. It represents the *what* dimension, it explains what is being collected or analysed. The data element often represents a count of something, and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. \"BCG doses given\" or “Malaria cases”. When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented, the data elements or expressions built upon data elements describes what the data is. As such the data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is collected, but more importantly how the data values are represented in the database, which again decides how data can be analysed and presented.\n\nIt is possible to add more details to this *what* dimension through the disaggregation dimension called data element categories. Some common categories are age and gender, but any category can be added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element's name and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system, and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of this dimension, but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the *what* dimension).\n\nChanges to data elements and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive and careful steps in the database design process.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on each step, you can refer to the DHIS2 user guides and implementers manual.\n\nSources:\n- [DHIS2 User Guide](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-240/additional-information/demo-server-live-package-and-database-design.html#database_design)\n- [Implementing DHIS2](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/implementing-dhis2/setting-up-a-new-database.html#data-elements)"

      "question": "Can I update a form via API?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can update a form via Typeform's API. To do this, you need to send a `PUT` request to the `https://api.typeform.com/forms/{form_id}` endpoint. The `{form_id}` should be replaced with the ID of the form you want to update.\n\nHere are some important points to note when updating a form:\n\n1. Your request body must include all the existing form fields, in addition to any new fields you want to add. If you don't include a field in your request, it will be deleted from the form. So, make sure your `PUT` request includes every field you want to keep in your updated form, including the field `id` [[source](https://www.typeform.com/developers/create/reference/update-form#forms)].\n\n2. The `PUT` request will overwrite the previously stored form with the given `form_id`. Any new fields in your request will be added to the form. Likewise, any fields you don't include in your request will be deleted from the form [[source](https://www.typeform.com/developers/create/walkthroughs#create-api-walkthroughs)].\n\n3. Be careful when updating fields in forms. `PUT` overwrites the entire form, so if you don't include each field (with the original field `id`) in your `PUT` request, the missing fields and results for those fields will be deleted [[source](https://www.typeform.com/developers/create/reference/update-form#forms)].\n\n4. If you have an unpublished draft in the builder, the changes made via the API will not be reflected in the Create panel. In this case, you can click the Publish button in the builder—this will overwrite any previous changes you’ve tried to make with the API. You’ll then be able to make another API call with the updates you want on your form [[source](https://www.typeform.com/help/a/api-troubleshooting-and-faq-13573500466836#h_01GTD5W3JKFHBZ5ZWM0MVFVH6M)].\n\n5. If you want to update multiple forms at once, unfortunately, there is currently no way to bulk update forms. The current API allows you to modify forms, but only one at a time [[source](https://community.typeform.com/typeform-developers-44/api-to-modify-forms-10977)].\n\nRemember to tread carefully when updating fields in forms as the `PUT` request overwrites the entire form."

      "answer": "It seems like you're trying to set up an Express app on Netlify that uses SendGrid to send emails. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the information from the knowledge sources:\n\n1. Install the necessary dependencies. If your Express project uses JavaScript, you can exclude `@netlify/functions` and `@types/express`.\n```bash\nnpm i express serverless-http @netlify/functions @types/express\n```\n2. Create a Netlify Function file for either TypeScript or JavaScript. For example, you might create a function file called `api.ts`.\n3. In the newly created file, write the function that will import Express and create a router object to handle routing. Here is an example:\n```javascript\n// YOUR_BASE_DIRECTORY/netlify/functions/api.ts\n\nimport express, { Router } from \"express\";\nimport serverless from \"serverless-http\";\n\nconst api = express();\n\nconst router = Router();\nrouter.get(\"/hello\", (req, res) => res.send(\"Hello World!\"));\n\napi.use(\"/api/\", router);\n\nexport const handler = serverless(api);\n```\n4. Add the following configuration in your `netlify.toml`:\n```toml\n[functions]\n  external_node_modules = [\"express\"]\n  node_bundler = \"esbuild\"\n[[redirects]]\n  force = true\n  from = \"/api/*\"\n  status = 200\n  to = \"/.netlify/functions/api/:splat\"\n```\n5. For the SendGrid integration, you can set up a function similar to the one shown in the forum post. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nconst sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');\n\nexports.handler = async (event, context) => {\n  console.log(\"Executing email.js\");\n  try {\n    const { name, email, message } = JSON.parse(event.body);\n\n    // Set up SendGrid API key\n    sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);\n\n    // Compose the email\n    const msg = {\n      to: process.env.CONTACT_EMAIL, // Replace with your email address\n      from: email,\n      subject: 'New Contact Form Submission',\n      text: `Name: ${name}\\nEmail: ${email}\\n\\nMessage: ${message}`,\n    };\n\n    // Send the email\n    await sgMail.send(msg);\n    console.log(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);\n    console.log(process.env.CONTACT_EMAIL);\n    return {\n      statusCode: 200,\n      body: 'Email sent successfully',\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Error sending email:', error);\n\n    return {\n      statusCode: 500,\n      body: 'An error occurred while sending the email',\n    };\n  }\n};\n```\nRemember to replace the placeholders with your actual values and adjust the code to fit your needs.\n\nSources:\n- [Deploy an Express app on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/express#deploy-an-express-app-on-netlify)\n- [Forum Post: Can't Send Email](https://answers.netlify.com/t/95306)"

      "question": "How to reset kafka offset value to read message",
      "answer": "In Mage, you can reset the Kafka offset value by using the `offset` configuration in your Kafka source configuration. This allows you to reset the offset when starting the streaming pipeline. The `offset` config has 4 optional values: `beginning`, `end`, `int`, and `timestamp`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can set it in your configuration:\n\n```yaml\noffset:  # Optional\n  value: null # Optional\n  type: \"int\"\n  partitions: # Optional\n  - {\"topic\": \"test\", \"partition\": 1}\n```\n\nIn this configuration:\n\n- `beginning` and `end` set the consumer to consume data from the beginning and end of the queue, respectively. They do not require `offset_value`.\n- `int` config sets the consumer to consume data from the given offset value inside the queue. This value corresponds to the numeric position inside each partition.\n- `timestamp` config sets the consumer to consume data from the given offset timestamp value inside the queue. This value corresponds to the timestamp of the message (Unit should be milliseconds since the beginning of the epoch).\n\nPlease note that if you are using the `offset` config, the `partitions` config is required. This feature is available in versions `>= 0.9.61`.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Mage documentation](https://docs.mage.ai/streaming/sources/kafka#basic-config)."

      "question": "Can you put some points for how we can track the live status of running process instance",
      "answer": "Sure, you can track the live status of a running process instance in Camunda using the following steps:\n\n1. **Start a new process instance**: You can start a new process instance by clicking on the blue **Run** button. If you're using the CLI client, you can start a new instance with a single command: `zbctl create instance camunda-cloud-quick-start-advanced` [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/orchestrate-microservices#design-your-process-with-bpmn)\n\n2. **View process instances**: In the top left corner of the screen, click the square-shaped **Camunda components** button. Navigate to Operate to see your process instance with a token waiting at the service task by clicking **View process instances**. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/orchestrate-microservices#design-your-process-with-bpmn)\n\n3. **Monitor the migration progress**: After the migration operation is started, you are redirected to the instances list view where the migration progress can be monitored in the operations panel. Click the **Instances** link in the operations panel entry to check how many process instances have been migrated to the target process version. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-migration#monitor-the-migration-progress)\n\n4. **Monitor performance indicators**: Monitor the following typical performance indicators *over all process definitions* at once: Number of *open executable jobs*, Number of *open incidents*, Number of *running process instances*. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/operations/operating-camunda-c7#monitoring-performance-indicators)\n\n5. **Check successful start in Operate**: The process start will be confirmed via a notification message on the screen. Click the **chevron icon** next to **Run** to open more options. Click **View process instances** to see the running process in Operate. In Operate, you will see a visualization of the running process instance. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/orchestrate-human-tasks#check-successful-start-in-operate)\n\n6. **Execute your process diagram**: You can now monitor your instances in Operate. Click the square-shaped **Camunda components** button to move between apps, and view process instances once in Operate. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/automating-a-process-using-bpmn#execute-your-process-diagram)\n\n7. **Run manually from Modeler**: After the process instance has been started, you will receive a notification with a link to the process instance view in Operate. Follow this link to observe the progress of the process instance and interact with it if required. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/run-or-publish-your-process#run-manually-from-modeler)\n\nRemember, in production, Operate is used to monitor both long-running and straight-through, high-throughput processes. In development environments, use Operate to confirm if the process flow works as expected."

      "question": "What's Camunda SaaS vs Self-Managed?",
      "answer": "Camunda offers two main deployment options: SaaS (Software as a Service) and Self-Managed.\n\n**Camunda SaaS** is a cloud-based service where Camunda handles the management of the resources needed for the performance and throughput of the platform. This includes the deployment of the Zeebe broker, an elastic database for Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize, and the Java applications for Optimize, Operate, and Tasklist. This option provides peace of mind as Camunda does the heavy lifting and provides everything as a service for you, allowing you to concentrate on your important work. Enterprise SaaS plans are tailored to your needs, and for more specific details, it's recommended to reach out to the enterprise team [here](https://camunda.com/platform/camunda-platform-enterprise-contact/). For local development purposes, developers could also create a cluster for development purposes in the SaaS offering of Camunda. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#camunda-deployment)\n\n**Camunda Self-Managed** is an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, where you host it yourself. This setup is highly customizable and can be deployed in different setups. The components available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed include Zeebe, Zeebe Gateway, Operate, Tasklist, Connectors, Optimize, Identity (not available in Camunda 8 SaaS), and Web Modeler (Enterprise only). Users may also use Desktop Modeler as an addition to these components. For deployment, Helm/Kubernetes is the recommended method, especially in production. Each component of Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed in single or high-availability mode, which provides minimal to no service interruption. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/about-self-managed)\n\nIn summary, the choice between SaaS and Self-Managed depends on your specific needs and resources. If you prefer to have more control over the deployment and management of the platform, Self-Managed might be the better option. If you prefer to have the management handled by Camunda, then the SaaS option would be more suitable. [source](https://forum.camunda.io/t/48042)"

      "answer": "Hmm, I don't know enough to give you a confident answer yet. The issue you're experiencing might not be related to Medusa or CORS configuration. It could be due to other factors such as your local development environment, network settings, or the specific setup of your project.\n\nHowever, if you suspect it's a CORS issue, you can double-check your CORS settings in your `medusa-config.js` file. By default, the Medusa starter runs on port `9000`, Medusa Admin runs on port `7001`, and the storefront starters run on port `8000`. The default configuration uses the following CORS settings:\n\n```javascript\n// CORS when consuming Medusa from admin  \nconst ADMIN_CORS = process.env.ADMIN_CORS ||   \n \"http://localhost:7000,http://localhost:7001\"  \n  \n// CORS to avoid issues when consuming Medusa from a client  \nconst STORE_CORS =   \n process.env.STORE_CORS || \"http://localhost:8000\"  \n```\n(Source: [Medusa Documentation - Troubleshooting CORS issues](https://docs.medusajs.com/troubleshooting/cors-issues))\n\nIf you've changed the ports your storefront or Medusa Admin run on, you should update these settings accordingly.\n\nFor more detailed information on configuring CORS in Medusa, you can refer to the [Medusa Backend Configuration Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/backend/configurations#projectconfig)."

      "answer": "The error message you're seeing, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`, is indicating that you're trying to call the `map` function on something that is `undefined`. In your code, this is happening at the line where you're trying to map over `linkedPulseIds`:\n\n```javascript\nconst currentCandidates = JSON.parse(currentValues.data.items[0].column_values[0].value).linkedPulseIds.map(item => item.linkedPulseId);\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when the object you're trying to access doesn't exist. In this case, it seems like `linkedPulseIds` is `undefined`. This could be because `currentValues.data.items[0].column_values[0].value` is `null` or doesn't contain the `linkedPulseIds` property.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should add a check to ensure that `linkedPulseIds` exists before trying to map over it. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```javascript\nconst columnValue = JSON.parse(currentValues.data.items[0].column_values[0].value);\nconst currentCandidates = columnValue && columnValue.linkedPulseIds ? columnValue.linkedPulseIds.map(item => item.linkedPulseId) : [];\n```\n\nIn this updated code, we first parse the column value and store it in a variable. Then, we check if this variable and the `linkedPulseIds` property exist. If they do, we map over `linkedPulseIds` as before. If they don't, we assign an empty array to `currentCandidates`.\n\nPlease note that this is a common JavaScript issue and is not specific to the monday.com API."

However, some general approaches could include:\n\n- Investigating any concurrent access issues, and implementing appropriate locking or synchronization mechanisms to prevent conflicts.\n- Checking the database system's configuration and performance, and making any necessary adjustments to improve its ability to handle locks.\n- In the case of the Sonatype IQ server, one suggestion was to add `LOCK_MODE=0` or `LOCK_TIMEOUT=30000` to the JDBC URL to adjust the locking behavior ([source](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/67647)).\n\nPlease note that these are general suggestions and the exact solution would depend on the specific circumstances and system configuration.

      "answer": "Your public key has not actually changed. What you're seeing is a different representation of your account address due to the interoperability of Substrate, which allows the same account to be used on most chains. Each network has its own address format. For example, the Polkadot format starts with \"1\", the Kusama format starts with a capital letter, and the generic Substrate format starts with \"5\". \n\nSo, even though an account has the same public and private keys in the background, it will have a different address on each network. As a result, you will see your account address changing as you switch networks on Polkadot-JS UI or choose a specific chain for your account in the Polkadot browser extension if you've enabled the account to be used on all chains.\n\nIf Polkadot-JS UI is showing the wrong address format for the network you are on, you can change it by navigating to the Settings tab, selecting \"Default for the connected node\" for both \"Default icon theme\" and \"Address prefix\", and clicking \"Save\". Your addresses will now always show in the correct format whether you switch to Polkadot, Kusama, or any other chain.\n\nIn the Polkadot extension, the address format depends on the chain you have chosen for that account. If you have chosen \"Allow on any chain,\" the format will be the generic Substrate format. However, as discussed above, it will change on Polkadot-JS UI when you switch networks. If you select a specific chain, the address format will be of that chain, and the account will be available only on that chain.\n\nYou can read more about this in the [Polkadot support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000103707-can-i-use-the-same-account-on-polkadot-kusama-and-parachains-) and see all the different network addresses corresponding to your account using [Subscan's handy transformer tool](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/format_transform).\n\nSources: [Polkadot Support](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000103852-my-address-starts-with-5-or-a-capital-letter-not-1-as-it-should-) and [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-accounts)"

      "answer": "Your code seems to be on the right track for creating a slash command in Discord that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. However, there are a few adjustments needed to ensure the correct interaction with the model.\n\nThe `messages` parameter in the `AI.chat.completions.create` function call should be a list of message objects. Each object should have a `role` that can be 'system', 'user', or 'assistant', and `content` which is the text of the message from that role. The 'system' role is generally used to set the behavior of the 'assistant' (which is the AI model).\n\nIn your case, you want to ask a question to the AI, so the role should be 'user'.

This is a known issue where the bundling process during Next.js's build does not copy over the necessary files to the output location of the bundle, causing errors like the one you're seeing.\n\nTo work around this issue, Prisma has created a custom Webpack plugin that correctly copies the files Prisma Client needs to their correct location. You can install this plugin with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -D @prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin\n```\n\nThen, you can import the plugin into your `next.config.js` file and use it in `config.plugins`:\n\n```javascript\nconst { PrismaPlugin } = require('@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin')\nmodule.exports = { webpack: (config, { isServer }) => { if (isServer) { config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new PrismaPlugin()] }\nreturn config },}\n```\n\nThis should help resolve the issue you're encountering.

      "answer": "Yes, it is possible to add properties to events via code. In Mixpanel, these additional bits of data are called \"properties\". They provide more detail about the event and allow you to capture more nuanced information.\n\nFor instance, in the Unity SDK, you can add properties to an event like this:\n\n```csharp\nvar props = new Value();\nprops[\"signup_button\"] = \"test12\";\n \nMixpanel.Track(\"signup\", props);\n```\n\nIn this example, a property called \"signup_button\" with a value of \"test12\" is added to the \"signup\" event.\n\nAdditionally, you can set \"super properties\" which are properties that you want to include with each event you send. These are generally things you know about the user rather than about a specific event. You can set super properties like this:\n\n```csharp\n// Send a \"User Type: Paid\" property will be sent\n// with all future track calls.\nMixpanel.Register(\"User Type\", \"Paid\");\n```\n\nIn this example, a super property called \"User Type\" with a value of \"Paid\" is registered. This property will be included with all future tracked events.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the Mixpanel documentation on [Unity SDK](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/unity) and [Event Tracking](https://mixpanel.com/blog/what-is-mobile-app-event-tracking)."

      "question": "How do I listen events with Ray actor?",
      "answer": "Ray Workflows supports pluggable event systems that allow an event to trigger a workflow. You can create custom event listeners by subclassing the `EventListener` interface. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.workflow.common import Event\n\nclass EventListener:\n    def __init__(self):\n \"\"\"Optional constructor. Only the constructor with no arguments will be\n called.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    async def poll_for_event(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Event:\n \"\"\"Should return only when the event is received.\"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n    async def event_checkpointed(self, event: Event) -> None:\n \"\"\"Optional. Called after an event has been checkpointed and a transaction can\n be safely committed.\"\"\"\n        pass\n```\n\nThe `listener.poll_for_events()` coroutine should finish when the event is done. Arguments to `workflow.wait_for_event` are passed to `poll_for_events()`. For example, an event listener which sleeps until a timestamp can be written as:\n\n```python\nclass TimerListener(EventListener):\n    async def poll_for_event(self, timestamp):\n        await asyncio.sleep(timestamp - time.time())\n```\n\nThe `event_checkpointed` routine can be overridden to support systems with exactly-once delivery semantics which typically follows a pattern of:\n1. Wait for an event.\n2. Process the event.\n3. Commit the event.\n\nAfter the workflow finishes checkpointing the event, the event listener will be invoked and can free the event. For example, to guarantee that events are consumed from a `kafkaesque` queue:\n\n```python\nKafkaEventType = ...\n\nclass QueueEventListener:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the poll consumer.\n        self.consumer = Consumer({'enable.auto.commit': False})\n\n    async def poll_for_event(self, topic) -> KafkaEventType:\n        self.consumer.subscribe(topic)\n\n        message = await self.consumer.poll()\n        return message\n\n    async def event_checkpointed(self, event: KafkaEventType) -> None:\n         self.consumer.commit(event, asynchronous=False)\n```\n\nYou can find more details in the [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/workflows/events.html)."

It is computed in the proxy contract as shown in the following example:\n\n```javascript\nroundId = uint80((uint256(phaseId) << 64) | aggregatorRoundId);\n```\n\nHere, `phaseId` is incremented each time the underlying aggregator implementation is updated and is used as a key to find the aggregator address. `aggregatorRoundId` is the aggregator `roundId` which starts at 1. `roundId` is the computed round id, which is a large number containing the `phaseId` and the `aggregatorRoundId`[^1^].\n\nIn the aggregator contracts, oracles provide periodic data updates to the aggregators. These data feeds are updated in **rounds**. Rounds are identified by their `roundId`, which increases with each new round.

The tokenomics involves transaction fees, inflation, and rewards.\n\n**Transaction Fees**: Every transaction made on the peaq networks incurs a fee, which is paid using PEAQ tokens. The transaction fees on peaq include a basic fee and an optional fee you can add on top of it to try and get the transaction validated faster. The basic fee depends on how much computation your transaction requires. The estimated base fee for a simple token transfer stands at less than $0.00025[^1^][^3^].\n\n**Inflation**: peaq's economics picks up a disinflationary approach, which means the inflation will be reduced over time, rewarding early backers. The inflation begins at 2.5% and decreases every year by 10% until it reaches 1%, which will become the fixed long-term rate[^1^].\n\n**Rewards**: The exact distribution of rewards between different stakeholders is being tested on krest as preparation for the peaq mainnet launch. The rewards for all network participants will come primarily from transaction fees[^1^][^5^].\n\n**Token Utility**: PEAQ tokens empower holders to vote on crucial network governance decisions, offering them a say in the network's future. The governance utility of PEAQ tokens encourages a decentralized and democratic decision-making process, ensuring the network evolves according to the community's interests[^2^].\n\n**Staking on Nodes**: peaq relies on the work of collators and delegators for block production. Collators take on the initial responsibility of creating blocks, which are later finalized by validators on the Relay chain. Delegators play a crucial role by backing up collators they trust, aiming to ensure the creation of blocks that remain resistant to censorship. In return, peaq shares network rewards with collators and delegators[^2^].\n\n[^1^]: [Source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/introducing-peaqs-economics-low-inflation-low-transaction-fees-innovative-rewards)\n[^2^]: [Source](https://docs.peaq.network/docs/learn/token-and-token-utility/token-and-token-utility-overview#token-utility)\n[^3^]: [Source](https://docs.peaq.network/docs/learn/economics)\n[^4^]: [Source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/introducing-peaqs-economics-low-inflation-low-transaction-fees-innovative-rewards)\n[^5^]: [Source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/peaq-a-layer-1-blockchain-designed-for-depins-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks)"

These styles are essentially different looks that you can choose from within the Flex theme. Each style comes with a default set of fonts and colors to help you set up your shop. The Flex theme currently has 12+ demo shops as theme styles. \n\nAfter purchasing the Flex theme, the theme downloads as a zip file called 'unzip-me-first.zip'. Once this file is unzipped, a folder called 'Welcome to Flex' gets created. This folder contains a main 'flex.zip' file, as well as zip files named after the current demo shops (for example, 'flex-swagger.zip'). If you want to start off with a different demo shop as your theme style, you can upload your demo shop zip of choice to Shopify. The theme will install with all of the sections, content, and settings as seen in that demo shop.\n\nPlease note that the concept of \"theme styles\" in the Flex theme differs from other Shopify themes, and there is no \"change theme style\" button with the theme editor.

      "question": "Can I use a Camunda 7 form in a Camunda 8 model",
      "answer": "Camunda 8 only supports Camunda Forms, and this support will be extended over time. If you rely on other form types that were available in Camunda 7, such as Embedded Task Forms or External Task Forms, you will need to convert them to Camunda Forms or use a bespoke tasklist where you still support those forms [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/migration-readiness#camunda-forms).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while you can incorporate Camunda Forms solely within Camunda 8, you can also utilize Camunda Forms in Camunda 7. After deploying a diagram with an embedded form, Tasklist imports this form schema and uses it to render the form on every task assigned to it [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/forms/camunda-forms-reference).\n\nIn terms of migrating user tasks from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8, only certain attributes/elements can be migrated. For example, task assignment attributes like `bpmn:humanPerformer`, `bpmn:potentialOwner`, `camunda:assignee` to `zeebe:assignmentDefinition assignee`, etc., can be migrated. However, form handling attributes like `camunda:formHandlerClass`, `camunda:formData`, `camunda:formProperty`, etc., cannot yet be migrated [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/adjusting-bpmn-models#user-tasks).\n\nTherefore, if you want to use a Camunda 7 form in a Camunda 8 model, you will need to convert it to a Camunda Form."

      "question": "When self hosting a cluster, if I were to migrate an elasticsearch instance later, would it be a huge PITA and would it impact liveness of workflows?",
      "answer": "Migrating Elasticsearch instances in a self-hosted Temporal cluster can indeed be complex, and it may impact the liveness of your workflows. \n\n1. **Impact on Workflows:** The unavailability of Elasticsearch should not affect the launch of already scheduled processes. However, if the Elasticsearch index is lost, previously scheduled workflows may not run as expected. This is because Temporal uses Elasticsearch for visibility features, such as listing workflows, and these features may be affected if Elasticsearch is unavailable or if the index is lost [source](https://community.temporal.io/t/4518).\n\n2. **Migration Process:** Migrating to a new Elasticsearch instance would involve ensuring the correct privileges are granted for the Elasticsearch Temporal index, including read, write, and custom search attributes privileges [source](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/visibility#elasticsearch). \n\n3. **Restoring Workflows:** Restoring the list of worker processes to the Elasticsearch index from Cassandra is not directly mentioned in the provided sources. However, Temporal does provide a way to migrate workflows, including running workflows, to a new Temporal cluster [source](https://docs.temporal.io/production-deployments/migration#migrating-your-workflow-executions). \n\n4. **Long-lived Workflows:** If your workflows are long-lived or generate a large volume of events, you may need to use techniques such as \"Continue-As-New\" to deal with event limits [source](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#dealing-with-very-long-lived-or-very-event-heavy-workflows).\n\n5. **Versioning:** When making changes to your workflow code, such as during a migration, you can use techniques like Task Queue–based versioning to isolate changes and prevent mistakes [source](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#task-queuebased-versioning).\n\nRemember, it's important to plan and test your migration process thoroughly to minimize impact on your workflows."

      "answer": "CircleCI provides two options for scheduling workflows: Scheduled Workflows and Scheduled Pipelines. \n\n**Scheduled Workflows** are defined using cron syntax on the workflow level in the `.circleci/config.yml` file. However, there are a few downsides to this approach:\n- It requires development work to make any changes to the schedule, or even to review schedules already in place.\n- In CircleCI, pipelines are triggered, not workflows.\n- Fine-tuning permissions was difficult because it was not always clear who scheduled the work that was triggered. [source](https://circleci.com/blog/using-scheduled-pipelines)\n\n**Scheduled Pipelines** are the primary method of scheduling work in CircleCI. They offer several advantages over Scheduled Workflows:\n- The ability to utilize dynamic configuration without a workaround\n- Allowed use of auto-canceling\n- The ability to modify the schedule without having to edit `.circleci/config.yml` [source](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060833331-Support-for-Scheduled-Workflows-in-Dynamic-Configurations-Setup-Workflows)\n\nTo create a new schedule using Scheduled Pipelines, you can follow these steps:\n1. In the CircleCI web app, navigate to **Projects** in the sidebar, then click the ellipsis (…​) next to your project and click on **Project Settings**.\n2. Navigate to **Triggers**.\n3. To create a new schedule, click **Add Trigger**.\n4. Define the new schedule by filling out the form, then click **Save Trigger**. [source](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines#use-project-settings)\n\nPlease note that Scheduled pipelines are not currently available for GitLab and GitHub App projects.

      "answer": "When a user navigates away from a page while streaming a response from the backend in Next.js, the streaming process is typically interrupted. This is because the browser cancels the HTTP request for the page that the user is navigating away from.\n\nIn Next.js, streaming is a feature that allows you to progressively render UI from the server. Work is split into chunks and streamed to the client as it becomes ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering. This feature is built into the Next.js App Router by default.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js before version 13. It's still supported in newer versions, but the new App Router is recommended to leverage React's latest features. If you're using the Pages Router and experiencing issues with streaming, it might be worth considering a migration to the App Router.\n\nIf you're self-hosting and using a proxy like Nginx, you'll need to configure it to disable buffering to enable streaming. This can be done by setting `X-Accel-Buffering` to `no` in your `next.config.js` file.\n\nSources:\n- [Next.js Docs - Streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#streaming)\n- [Next.js Docs - Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages)\n- [Next.js Docs - Deploying](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#streaming-and-suspense)"

      "question": "why should I right size resource classes",
      "answer": "Right-sizing resource classes in CircleCI is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Optimized Performance:** By specifying the compute resource size (CPU and RAM) for running a job, you can ensure that your jobs have the necessary resources to run efficiently. This can help to prevent slowdowns or bottlenecks in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency:** CircleCI uses a credit-based system for usage, and different resource classes will consume different amounts of credits. By right-sizing your resource classes, you can ensure that you're not over-provisioning (and thus overpaying) for resources that your jobs don't need.\n\n3. **Avoiding Concurrency Limits:** CircleCI implements soft concurrency limits for each resource class to ensure system stability. If you're on a Performance or custom plan and experience queuing for certain resource classes, it could be because you're hitting these limits. Right-sizing your resource classes can help to avoid this issue.\n\n4. **Default Values Can Change:** If you do not specify a resource class, CircleCI will use a default value that is subject to change. It is best practice to specify a resource class as opposed to relying on a default.\n\nHere's an example of how to specify a resource class in your `.circleci/config.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    docker: # use the Docker executor\n      - image: cimg/base:2022.09 # specify a Docker image\n    resource_class: xlarge # specify a resource class\n    steps:\n      - run: echo \"Hello World\"\n```\n\nFor a full list of available resource class options, see the [configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#resourceclass).\n\nSources: \n- [Resource class overview](https://circleci.com/docs/resource-class-overview)\n- [Configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#resourceclass)\n- [Optimization reference](https://circleci.com/docs/optimizations#docker-image-choice)"

      "answer": "In the context of Portainer, a \"node\" is described as a \"server\" that is capable of running containers via Docker, Kubernetes, or another orchestrator. This server could be an actual physical server, a VM, a Raspberry Pi, your desktop or laptop, an industrial computer, or an embedded computing device. A node is either running the Portainer Server or is under the management of a Portainer Server installation.\n\nFor Docker, anything that runs Portainer, whether that be Portainer Server or Portainer Agent, is considered a node. This includes each server in a clustered environment like Docker Swarm where the Portainer Agent will be running.\n\nFor Kubernetes, the Portainer Agent accesses the Kubernetes API to manage the entire cluster and determine the number of nodes in the cluster. You can also determine the number of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster by running the command `kubectl get nodes` on a server in your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nIf you're running multiple environments, the total number of nodes would be the sum of all nodes in each environment.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to these sources: [Source 1](https://www.portainer.io/pricing-packaging-faq-july23), [Source 2](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes), [Source 3](https://www.portainer.io/pricing), [Source 4](https://www.portainer.io/contact-sales), [Source 5](https://www.portainer.io/get-demo), [Source 6](https://www.portainer.io/business-edition-end-user-license-agreement), [Source 7](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes), [Source 8](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes)."

In some cases, you may want additional boundaries like school districts, community areas, or sub-market boundaries for your customers. You can extend Mapbox Boundaries with any custom polygon data and deliver the same frontend, API-driven services for data visualization, analysis, and geofencing applications around the world.\n\nTo use a Mapbox Boundaries tileset in your application, you need to make a request from the Mapbox Vector Tiles API for the relevant tileset.

You can customize this code to showcase only the boundaries you want to display.\n\nPlease note that access to the Mapbox Boundaries tilesets is controlled by Mapbox account access token. If you do not have access on your account, you need to contact Mapbox sales to request access to Boundaries tilesets.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Mapbox Boundaries documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/boundaries/reference/mapbox-boundaries-v1) and the [tutorial on extending Mapbox Boundaries](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/extend-mapbox-boundaries)."

If other instances of AvalancheGo are running concurrently, your Avalanche-CLI network fails to start. \n\nTo troubleshoot this, you can start by shutting down any Avalanche nodes started by Avalanche-CLI using the following command:\n\n```bash\navalanche network clean --hard  \n```\n\nNext, look for any lingering AvalancheGo processes with:\n\n```bash\nps aux | grep avalanchego  \n```\n\nIf any processes are running, you need to stop them before you can launch your VM with Avalanche-CLI. However, if you're running a validator node on the same box you're using Avalanche-CLI, do not end any of these lingering AvalancheGo processes. This may shut down your validator and could affect your validation uptime. \n\nAnother possible cause of the error could be an RPC protocol version mismatch. AvalancheGo communicates with custom VMs over RPC using gRPC. Both components must be running the same RPC version for VM deployment to work. Your custom VM's RPC version is set by the version of AvalancheGo that you import.

      "answer": "To make your Flex 5.1 theme compatible with Online Store 2.0, you need to update your theme to Flex version 3.0.0 or later, as these versions are compatible with Online Store 2.0. \n\nHere are the steps to update your theme:\n\n1. Manually update to Flex v3+ to harness the full suite of Theme Updater Plus's Pro plan features. You can follow the instructions for [updating a theme manually](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409266932883).\n\n2. After updating, you will need to rebuild your home page content. Global theme settings will be preserved in the update, but content built in the theme editor, including home page sections, will need to be reconfigured using the new OS 2.0 editor. This is a one-time process that is required to update into the new editor.\n\n3. Once the update is complete, your theme will be fully compatible with [Theme Updater Plus's full suite of Updater Pro Plan features](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7321417157139).\n\nPlease note that Flex theme versions released before 6.0.0 are considered 'vintage' themes and have limited compatibility with the latest Shopify features. Therefore, it's recommended to update to the latest version to make use of Online Store 2.0 features.\n\nSources:\n- [Flex release notes](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033105314-Flex-release-notes#01GET43CYM68T6YV3R06EYCFT6)\n- [Should I use Theme Updater Plus to migrate my vintage theme?](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/9186251139603-Should-I-use-Theme-Updater-Plus-to-migrate-my-vintage-theme#01GBX8SKTQV5TXWJ1YMXQAZ05N)\n- [Flex release notes > Vintage Theme Versions](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033105314-Flex-release-notes#01GET43CYM9H23FWHYB0QN260R)"

      "answer": "The cart icon might be hidden due to some changes in your theme's code. If you or someone else has added a `hide` class to the cart icon in your theme's code, it would prevent the cart icon from showing. Here's how you can check and fix it:\n\n1. Open your theme editor and go to the Edit code option.\n2. Look for the `header-icons.liquid` file in your snippets folder.\n3. Search for `href=\"/cart\"` and you'll come across a block of code that starts with this:\n```html\n<a href=\"/cart\" class=\"site-nav__link site-nav__link--icon js-drawer-open-cart js-no-transition\" aria-controls=\"CartDrawer\">\n```\n4. If there's a class of `hide` in the code, like this:\n```html\n<a href=\"/cart\" class=\"hide site-nav__link site-nav__link--icon js-drawer-open-cart js-no-transition\" aria-controls=\"CartDrawer\">\n```\n5. Remove the `hide` class so your code now looks like this:\n```html\n<a href=\"/cart\" class=\"site-nav__link site-nav__link--icon js-drawer-open-cart js-no-transition\" aria-controls=\"CartDrawer\">\n```\nThis should make the cart icon visible again. If you're not comfortable editing the code yourself, you might want to consider working with a Shopify Expert or Developer to customize your theme.

      "question": "in refine how do i implement internationalization in nextjs with material ui",
      "answer": "To implement internationalization (i18n) in a Next.js application with Material UI using Refine, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create an `i18nProvider`**: Refine expects the `i18nProvider` type as follows:\n\n```jsx\nimport { I18nProvider } from \"@refinedev/core\";  \n  \nconst i18nProvider: I18nProvider = {  \n translate: (key: string, options?: any, defaultMessage?: string) => string,  \n changeLocale: (lang: string, options?: any) => Promise,  \n getLocale: () => string,  \n};  \n```\n2. **Pass the `i18nProvider` to the `<Refine />` component**: After creating a `i18nProvider`, you can pass it to the `<Refine />` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Refine } from \"@refinedev/core\";  \n  \nimport i18nProvider from \"./i18nProvider\";  \n  \nconst App: React.FC = () => {  \n return (  \n <Refine  \n i18nProvider={i18nProvider}  \n /* ... */  \n >  \n {/* ... */}  \n </Refine>  \n );  \n};  \n```\n3. **Use the provided hooks**: Refine provides hooks for translation features:\n\n- [`useTranslate`](https://refine.dev/docs/i18n/hooks/use-translate/) shows translation between different languages.\n- [`useSetLocale`](https://refine.dev/docs/i18n/hooks/use-set-locale/) changes locale at runtime.\n- [`useGetLocale`](https://refine.dev/docs/i18n/hooks/use-get-locale/) getting current locale.\n\n4. **Integrate with Material UI**: Refine provides an integration package for Material UI. This package provides a set of ready to use components and hooks that connects Refine with Material UI components. You can use all the features of Material UI in the same way you would use it in a regular React application. [More info here](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/material-ui/introduction)\n\n5. **Example for Next.js**: Refine provides an example of how to use different language options and translations in practice with Next.js. You can run this example on your local machine using the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm create refine-app@latest -- --example i18n-nextjs  \n```\n[More info here](https://refine.dev/docs/examples/i18n/i18n-nextjs)\n\nPlease note that you need to have basic knowledge of React and TypeScript, Node.js installed on your machine, and a code editor of your choice to follow along with this tutorial.

      "answer": "To set up login in Go using Ory, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Go app**: You can create a Go app by running the following commands:\n\n```bash\nmkdir your-project  \ncd your-project  \n  \ntouch main.go handler.go middleware.go index.html  \ngo mod init github.com/<your-name>/your-project  \n```\n[Source](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/integrate-auth/go)\n\n2. **Install Ory SDK**: You can install the Ory SDK by running the following command:\n\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/ory/client-go  \n```\n[Source](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/integrate-auth/go)\n\n3. **Create Middleware**: Create middleware that checks if the user has a valid session. The session is considered valid when the user is authenticated. The middleware passes the current `request` cookies to the Ory client to check if the session is valid. If the session is valid, the user is presented with the protected page. When the session is not valid, the request is redirected for login using the Ory Account Experience. You can create the middleware by adding the following code to the `middleware.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage main  \n  \nimport (  \n \"context\"  \n \"log\"  \n \"net/http\"  \n  \n ory \"github.com/ory/client-go\"  \n)  \n  \n// save the cookies for any upstream calls to the Ory apis  \nfunc withCookies(ctx context.Context, v string) context.Context {  \n return context.WithValue(ctx, \"req.cookies\", v)  \n}  \n  \nfunc getCookies(ctx context.Context) string {  \n return ctx.Value(\"req.cookies\").(string)  \n}  \n  \n// save the session to display it on the dashboard  \nfunc withSession(ctx context.Context, v *ory.Session) context.Context {  \n return context.WithValue(ctx, \"req.session\", v)  \n}  \n  \nfunc getSession(ctx context.Context) *ory.Session {  \n return ctx.Value(\"req.session\").(*ory.Session)  \n}  \n  \nfunc (app *App) sessionMiddleware(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {  \n return func(writer http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) {  \n log.Printf(\"handling middleware request\\n\")  \n  \n // set the cookies on the ory client  \n var cookies string  \n  \n // this example passes all request.Cookies  \n // to `ToSession` function  \n //  \n // However, you can pass only the value of  \n // ory_session_projectid cookie to the endpoint  \n cookies = request.Header.Get(\"Cookie\")  \n  \n // check if we have a session  \n session, _, err := app.ory.FrontendApi.ToSession(request.Context()).Cookie(cookies).Execute()  \n if (err != nil && session == nil) || (err == nil && !*session.Active) {  \n // this will redirect the user to the managed Ory Login UI\n```\n[Source](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/integrate-auth/go#validate-and-login)\n\n4. **Submit Login Flow**: To submit or complete a login flow you need to call the `updateLoginFlow` endpoint. You can do this by adding the following code to the `login.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage frontend  \n  \nimport (  \n \"context\"  \n \"fmt\"  \n \"os\"  \n  \n \"github.com/ory/client-go\"  \n)  \n  \ntype oryMiddleware struct {  \n ory *ory.APIClient  \n}  \n  \nfunc init() {  \n cfg := client.NewConfiguration()  \n cfg.Servers = client.ServerConfigurations{  \n {URL: fmt.Sprintf(\"https://%s.projects.oryapis.com\", os.Getenv(\"ORY_PROJECT_SLUG\"))},  \n }  \n  \n ory = client.NewAPIClient(cfg)  \n}  \n  \nfunc Submit"

      "answer": "In the Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android, you can customize the camera during active navigation by managing two parts: specifying a data source and passing that data to the navigation camera. The SDK's `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource` produces the data in the form of map camera targets, and `NavigationCamera` consumes and executes that data to determine the camera's behavior [source](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/v2/guides/ui-components/camera).\n\nYou can adjust the way location and geometries are framed within the padding by changing the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSourceOptions`, which are accessible via `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource#options`. For example, to change the default pitch during following, you can use the following code:\n\n```kotlin\nviewportDataSource.options.followingFrameOptions.defaultPitch = 35.0  \nviewportDataSource.evaluate()  \n```\n\nYou can understand all possible camera behaviors by looking at the available properties for both `FollowingFrameOptions` and `OverviewFrameOptions` [source](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/v2/guides/ui-components/camera#options).\n\nAlso, make sure to browse through the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource.options` and read about customization to the generated camera positions and how you can tweak the algorithms and change the user experience [source](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/v2/guides/migrate-to-v2#options)."

      "answer": "Yes, there are certain fees associated with using the Wormhole protocol. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Source Chain Gas**: Gas fees on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum) must be covered by the user. This is the cost of performing transactions on the blockchain where the assets are initially located.\n\n2. **Relayer Fee [Source Chain => Gateway]**: This is the cost for a Wormhole message to be processed. Currently, this fee is set to `0` but may change in the future.\n\n3. **Destination Chain Gas [Non Cosmos]**: Gas fees on a destination chain (e.g., Ethereum) must be covered by either the relayer or, in the case of manual redemption, the user.\n\n4. **Native ETH and wstETH Transfers**: The Wormhole protocol has added Native ETH and Lido wstETH transfer software to the platform. Transfer fees for these assets are typically around 0.02%-0.04%.\n\n5. **XPLA Blockchain**: The XPLA blockchain offers an average transaction network fee of 0.13 XPLA (approximately $0.10).\n\nIt's important to note that not all fees are required. For instance, the Gateway doesn't have token-priced metering or require gas fees to be paid by the user. Also, IBC relayers cover the processing cost on the destination chain in the Cosmos network, so users don't have to pay for that.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following sources:\n- [Wormhole Documentation](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/gateway#fee-structure)\n- [Wormhole Blog](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-launches-native-token-transfers-starting-with-native-eth-and-wsteth-across-7-evm-chains)\n- [Wormhole Blog - XPLA](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-chains-xpla#speed-costs)"

      "question": "What is RunID in Temporal?",
      "answer": "In Temporal, a Run Id is a globally unique, platform-level identifier for a Workflow Execution. It is used to distinguish between different invocations of a workflow. Since Temporal only allows one actively running (“Open”) Workflow instance per Workflow ID, the Run ID exists to distinguish between invocations. \n\nIn the context of the Temporal SDKs, when a Run ID is not given, the currently running (or most recent, in the case of Queries) instance is used. It's also worth noting that workflows don’t have a Run ID until they are running. \n\nIn the Temporal Java SDK, methods like `getRunId()` can be used to retrieve the Run ID, which is a unique identifier of one workflow code execution. Similarly, in the Temporal TypeScript SDK, properties like `runId` are used to represent the ID of the currently active run of the workflow.\n\nSources:\n- [Glossary > Run Id](https://docs.temporal.io/glossary#run-id)\n- [Blog > Long-Running Workflows > How to Keep a Workflow Running Indefinitely Long > Continue-As-New Part 7](https://temporal.io/blog/very-long-running-workflows)\n- [Java SDK > Static > Io.temporal > Temporal-sdk > 1.22.3 > G Part 123](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.22.3/index-all.html)\n- [Forum Post: How to associate a workflow run ID with the schedule that triggered it? > Official Answer](https://community.temporal.io/t/9554)\n- [TypeScript SDK > Api > Classes > Class: WorkflowActivation > Properties > runId](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/proto.coresdk.workflow_activation.WorkflowActivation#runid)"

      "question": "How do I work with it and how do I use it? ",
      "answer": "To work with Wormhole, you need to understand its basic functionality. Wormhole is an interoperability protocol that allows projects to build on top of its generic message-passing layer. It connects to multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Algorand, Fantom, Karura, Celo, Acala, Aptos, and Arbitrum. Wormhole does this by emitting messages from one chain to another, which are observed and verified by a Guardian network of nodes. After verification, this message is submitted to the target chain for processing. This simple message-passing primitive enables xChain functionality. Users interact with xDapps (xChain decentralized applications) to transfer xAssets (cross-chain assets) between networks or access their xData (xChain data) to provide them services on their current network [source](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-wins-community-vote-to-bring-uniswap-v3-to-binances-bnb-chain#wormhole-noob-no-problem).\n\nTo use Wormhole, you can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the Wormhole tutorial. This tutorial also includes FAQs and documentation that can help you understand the process better [source](https://wormhole.com/welcome-karura#how-to-use-wormhole).\n\nFor developers, Wormhole provides a powerful base layer upon which many 'bridge' applications can be built. Because Wormhole is capable of verifying arbitrary data, bridges utilizing it are able to transfer native currencies, tokens, NFTs, oracle data, governance votes, and a whole host of other forms of decentralized data [source](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/sdk/js/README.md).\n\nRemember, Wormhole is a complex protocol and it's recommended to have a good understanding of blockchain technology before using it."

      "question": "with our Jira plugin, is it possible to create a jira ticket or call another endpoint based on the organisation of the application in Sonatype?",
      "answer": "The Sonatype for Jira plugin is designed to automate the creation of Jira tickets for policy violations. When a new violation occurs, a Jira ticket is created in the linked application, and it automatically creates a ticket per component. This allows development teams to focus on application security and easily find and triage policy violations with a tool that they're already using for story tracking and bug fixes.\n\nHowever, the plugin's functionality is not explicitly designed to create a Jira ticket or call another endpoint based on the organization of the application in Sonatype. The plugin uses a webhook event to trigger the creation of tickets when new policy violations occur, not based on the organization of the application.\n\nTo configure the Sonatype for Jira Cloud Plugin, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the Plugin from the Atlassian Marketplace.\n2. Configure the plugin in Jira Cloud.\n3. Configure the plugin per project to receive tickets.\n4. Add a webhook to the Jira Cloud in IQ Server.\n5. Set up notifications on the Lifecycle policy.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, please refer to the [Sonatype for Jira Cloud documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-for-jira-cloud.html).\n\nIf you need to create a Jira ticket or call another endpoint based on the organization of the application, you might need to develop a custom solution or explore other plugins that might offer this functionality."

      "answer": "To fetch all nodes in LlamaIndex, you would typically load your data into Document objects, parse these into Node objects, and then build an Index over these Node objects. Here's an example of how you might do this in Python, using the LlamaIndex library:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter\n\n# Load your data into Document objects\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"./data/paul_graham/\").load_data()\n\n# Parse these into Node objects\nnode_parser = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=512)\nnodes = node_parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\n\n# Manually set node ids to ensure same id's per run\nfor idx, node in enumerate(nodes):\n    node.id_ = f\"node_{idx}\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we're loading data from a directory of text files, splitting each document into chunks of 512 characters to create our nodes, and then assigning each node a unique ID. The resulting `nodes` list contains all of our Node objects.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and the actual process may vary depending on your specific use case and data.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/understanding/indexing/indexing.html) and [this example](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/evaluation/retrieval/retriever_eval.ipynb) from the LlamaIndex GitHub repository."

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project depends on several factors such as the specific application needs, power consumption, cost, and the required range of operation. Here are some considerations:\n\n1. **Link Budget, Energy Consumption, and Cost**: You need to determine whether a Sub GHz or 2.4 GHz transceiver will best serve your application needs. For instance, 2.4 GHz wireless standards such as Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi™ are widely used for high data rate connectivity. However, they have limited range, poor wall penetration, and higher power consumption. On the other hand, Sub GHz radios offer substantially higher range than 2.4 GHz radios, have much lower power consumption, and can provide connectivity for devices that must operate for years on a single battery. These factors, combined with low system cost, make Sub GHz transceivers ideal for low data rate applications that need maximum range and multi-year battery life, such as smoke detectors, door/window sensors, and outdoor systems such as weather stations and asset tracking. [Source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Internet-of-Things-System-Design-with-Integrated-Wireless-MCUs.pdf)\n\n2. **Multiprotocol Implementation**: Implementing more than one protocol on a single device allows for cost savings, space savings, and energy savings. A single device can perform more than one function, end-user product packaging can be smaller and simpler when protocols can share a single radio, and the number of devices on a network is reduced. [Source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf)\n\n3. **Security**: Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation. You need to review and decide on the level of security required by your specific application and use cases. [Source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)\n\n4. **Wireless Technologies**: A diverse set of wireless technologies exists in the networking marketplace. For the long term, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Smart, and 802.15.4 mesh networking protocols are seen as leading protocols in the connected home and IoT. Each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice would depend on the specific requirements of your IoT project. [Source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Thread-Ushering-in-Era-of-Connectivity.pdf)\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol can significantly impact the performance, cost, and success of your IoT project. Therefore, it's crucial to make an informed decision based on your project's specific needs."

      "answer": "The error message you're seeing suggests that the database you're trying to insert data into does not exist in your CockroachDB cluster. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Check the database name**: Ensure that the database name you're using is correct. You can see your cluster's databases by running the `SHOW DATABASES` command in the CockroachDB SQL shell. \n\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```\n\n2. **Check the cluster name**: If you're using a third-party tool to connect to your CockroachDB cluster, make sure you're using the correct cluster name. If the cluster name is incorrect, you might see an error message like `FATAL: CodeParamsRoutingFailed: rejected by BackendConfigFromParams: Invalid cluster name`. You can find the correct cluster name in the CockroachDB Cloud Console by navigating to **Cluster Overview** > **Connect** > **Step 2. Connect** > **Connection parameters**. [^1^]\n\n3. **Check your connection**: Make sure you're connected to the correct CockroachDB cluster. If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, for example, you can set CockroachDB as a data source and enter your database's connection string in the **General** tab. The connection string should include the correct host, port, database, user, and password. [^2^]\n\nIf you've checked all of these and you're still seeing the error, it's possible that there's an issue with your CockroachDB setup. You might want to look into any recent changes you've made to your cluster or any issues reported in the CockroachDB GitHub repository.

I'd like to arrange the schedules so that no workflow happens at the same time. Can i set a cron syntax schedule so that each trigger happens at a particular minute in an hour or will the run start anywhere in that hour?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can set up your pipelines to be scheduled at a specific time of day using cron syntax. However, it's important to note that CircleCI does not guarantee precision in the execution of scheduled pipelines. When you set a schedule, it will be run as if the commit was pushed at the configured time. For example, if you set the schedule as 1 per-hour for 08:00 UTC, the scheduled pipeline will run once within the 08:00 to 09:00 UTC window. It does not mean that it will run at 08:00 UTC exactly. However, subsequent runs of the scheduled pipeline will always be run on the same time as its previous run. \n\nYou can use an online tool like [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/#0_0_*_*_*) to generate cron schedule expressions. \n\nTo set up the schedule, you can use either the API or the GUI with the new timetable configuration, and the `run-schedule` pipeline parameter. \n\nHere is an example of how to set up a schedule in your config file:\n```yaml\nparameters:\n  run-schedule:\n    type: boolean\n    default: false\n\nworkflows:\n  build-test-deploy:\n    when:\n      not: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>\n    jobs:\n      ...\n\n  nightly-snapshot:\n    when: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>\n    jobs:\n      ...\n```\nIn this example, the `run-schedule` parameter is used to control when the workflows run. The `build-test-deploy` workflow will run when `run-schedule` is `false`, and the `nightly-snapshot` workflow will run when `run-schedule` is `true`.\n\nSources:\n- [CircleCI Blog: Using Scheduled Pipelines](https://circleci.com/blog/using-scheduled-pipelines)\n- [CircleCI Docs: Scheduled Pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines#use-project-settings)\n- [CircleCI Docs: FAQ](https://circleci.com/docs/faq#can-i-migrate-existing-scheduled-workflows)"

      "answer": "From the information you've provided, it seems like you're encountering a 'decode error' when trying to use the video inference API on Roboflow. This could be due to a variety of reasons, and it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue without more context. However, here are a few things you could check:\n\n1. **Video Format**: Ensure that the video file you’re trying to process is in a format that the Roboflow API can process. The video inference currently supports the following video file-extensions: mp4, MP4, avi, AVI, mkv, MKV, webm, WEBM. If the file format is not supported, this could result in an error ([source](https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/hosted-api/video-inference#important-notes)).\n\n2. **API Usage**: Make sure you're using the API correctly. You can refer to the [Roboflow documentation](https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/hosted-api/video-inference/use-a-fine-tuned-model) on how to use a fine-tuned model with the Video Inference API for guidance.\n\n3. **Model Training Date**: Currently, Roboflow's video inference only supports models trained within Roboflow after June 30th, 2023. If your model was trained before this date, it might not be supported ([source](https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/hosted-api/video-inference/use-a-fine-tuned-model)).\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve your issue, I would recommend reaching out to Roboflow’s support for further assistance. They might be able to provide more specific guidance based on your account details and the specifics of your project."

      "answer": "Yes, it is possible to upload images or other media within a Devvit app. You can add images to your app, which can then be uploaded to Reddit and accessed in your app source code when you upload your app. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Locate the `assets` folder at the root of your project directory (or create one if it’s not there).\n2. Create your image in PNG format and add it to the `assets` folder.\n3. Update your code to import the new asset. Here’s an example:\n\n```typescript\nDevvit.configure({  \n redditAPI: true  \n});  \n  \nconst render: Devvit.CustomPostComponent = () => {  \n return (  \n <vstack padding=\"medium\" gap=\"medium\" cornerRadius=\"medium\">  \n <text style=\"heading\" size=\"xxlarge\">  \n Hello!  \n </text>  \n <image url=\"hello.png\" imageWidth={128} imageHeight={128}/>  \n </vstack>  \n );  \n};  \n  \nDevvit.addCustomPostType({  \n name: 'My custom post',  \n description: 'Test custom post for showing a custom asset!',  \n render,  \n});  \n  \n  \nDevvit.addMenuItem({  \n location: 'subreddit',  \n label: 'Make custom post with image asset',  \n onPress: async (event, context) => {  \n const subreddit = await context.reddit.getSubredditById(context.subredditId);  \n  \n await context.reddit.submitPost({  \n subredditName: subreddit.name,  \n title: 'Custom post!',  \n preview: render(context),  \n });  \n }  \n});  \n```\n\n4. Run `devvit upload`.\n5. Install or update your app on your subreddit.\n6. From the subreddit menu, click \"Make custom post with image asset\". This will create a new post with the image embedded in it.\n\nPlease note that the image file name is case-sensitive and needs to reside in the “assets” folder.

      "answer": "To get `filterDropdown` options from an API in Refine, you can use the `useSelect` hook. This hook can be used to populate the props of the `Select` component inside the `FilterDropdown` component. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```jsx\nimport {  \n List,  \n FilterDropdown,  \n useTable,  \n useSelect\n} from \"@refinedev/antd\";  \nimport { Table, Select } from \"antd\";  \n  \nconst PostList: React.FC = (props) => {  \n const { tableProps } = useTable<IPost>();  \n const { selectProps: categorySelectProps } = useSelect<ICategory>({  \n resource: \"categories\",  \n optionLabel: \"title\",  \n optionValue: \"id\",  \n});  \n\n return (  \n <List>  \n <Table {...tableProps} rowKey=\"id\">  \n <Table.Column dataIndex=\"id\" title=\"ID\" />  \n <Table.Column  \n dataIndex={[\"category\", \"id\"]}  \n title=\"Category\"  \n key=\"category.id\"  \n filterDropdown={(props) => (  \n <FilterDropdown {...props}>  \n <Select {...categorySelectProps} />  \n </FilterDropdown>  \n )}  \n />  \n </Table>  \n </List>  \n );  \n};  \n  \ninterface IPost {  \n id: number;  \n category: {  \n id: number;  \n };  \n}  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `useSelect` hook is used to fetch categories from an API and populate the `Select` component inside the `FilterDropdown` component. The `resource` prop is set to \"categories\", which is the endpoint of the API from where the categories are fetched. The `optionLabel` and `optionValue` props are used to specify the properties of the fetched data that should be used as the label and value of the select options, respectively.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `\"categories\"` with your actual API endpoint, and `\"title\"` and `\"id\"` with the actual properties of your data.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/components/filter-dropdown#usage)."

      "question": "explain iplementation of Query and QueryResult from llama_index.core",
      "answer": "In LlamaIndex, the query process is implemented through query engine classes. These classes implement a `query` method that takes in a `str` or `QueryBundle` as input and outputs a `Response` object. The `query` method performs retrieval and synthesis before returning the final result. For instance, the `RetrieverQueryEngine` takes in a `retriever` and a `BaseSynthesizer` class for response synthesis as inputs. \n\nHere is an example of how a query is made using the `RetrieverQueryEngine`:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, get_response_synthesizer\nfrom llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever\nfrom llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine\nfrom llama_index.core.postprocessor import SimilarityPostprocessor\n\n# build index\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n\n# configure retriever\nretriever = VectorIndexRetriever(\n    index=index,\n    similarity_top_k=10,\n)\n\n# configure response synthesizer\nresponse_synthesizer = get_response_synthesizer()\n\n# assemble query engine\nquery_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(\n    retriever=retriever,\n    response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer,\n    node_postprocessors=[SimilarityPostprocessor(similarity_cutoff=0.7)],\n)\n\n# query\nresponse = query_engine.query(\"What did the author do growing up?\")\nprint(response)\n```\nIn this example, the `query` method of the `RetrieverQueryEngine` is used to retrieve and synthesize a response to the query \"What did the author do growing up?\".\n\nAs for the `QueryResult`, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. However, in the context of a Vector Store, a `VectorStoreQueryResult` is returned by the `query` method. This result includes nodes, similarities, and node IDs.\n\n```python\ndef query(\n        self,\n        query: VectorStoreQuery,\n        **kwargs: Any,\n    ) -> VectorStoreQueryResult:\n        \"\"\"Get nodes for response.\"\"\"\n        # 1. First filter by metadata\n        nodes = self.node_dict.values()\n        if query.filters is not None:\n            nodes = filter_nodes(nodes, query.filters)\n        if len(nodes) == 0:\n            result_nodes = []\n            similarities = []\n            node_ids = []\n        else:\n            # 2. Then perform semantic search\n            similarities, node_ids = dense_search(query, nodes)\n            result_nodes = [self.node_dict[node_id] for node_id in node_ids]\n        return VectorStoreQueryResult(\n            nodes=result_nodes, similarities=similarities, ids=node_ids\n        )\n```\nIn this example, the `query` method of the Vector Store returns a `VectorStoreQueryResult` that includes the result nodes, their similarities to the query, and their IDs.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/understanding/querying/querying.html) and the [LlamaIndex GitHub repository](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/llama_index/query_engine/retriever_query_engine.py)."

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project involves considering several factors such as standards compliance, networking topology, interoperability, frequency range, and message throughput. Silicon Labs offers a variety of wireless protocols, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. **Silicon Labs Flex SDK**: This includes the IEEE 802.15.4-based \"Connect\" stack for multi-hop \"star\" network topologies, and the Radio Abstraction Interface Library (RAIL) for proprietary designs with custom RF configurations.\n\n2. **EmberZNet**: A Zigbee PRO-based mesh networking stack. It's ideal for applications that require a robust, secure, and scalable mesh network supporting more than 250 nodes.\n\n3. **Silicon Labs Bluetooth SDK**: A Bluetooth networking stack, ideal for connecting point solutions to smartphones and for bulk data transfers on battery-power devices.\n\n4. **Silicon Labs Bluetooth mesh SDK**: A companion to the Bluetooth SDK supporting Bluetooth mesh networks.\n\nIn addition to these, there are other wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Smart, and 802.15.4 mesh networking protocols like ZigBee PRO and Thread. Each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on your specific application needs.\n\nFor example, Wi-Fi is great for transporting audio, video, and data throughout the home, but its high data rates and output power demand a lot of power, limiting its utility for battery-powered applications. Bluetooth Smart is ideal for connecting point solutions to smartphones and for bulk data transfers on battery-powered devices. Mesh technologies like ZigBee PRO and Thread form the backbone of a connected home, optimized to support low bandwidth control and automation applications where multi-year battery life is critical.\n\nYou can also consider implementing more than one protocol on a single device for cost, space, and energy savings. Silicon Labs' EFR32 products allow two protocols to share the same radio, enabling dynamic multiprotocol implementation.\n\nFinally, security is a crucial aspect to consider when implementing an IoT solution. Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation. Silicon Labs tools are designed to support the various levels of security provided by the protocol in question.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documents:\n- [UG103.03: Fundamentals of Design Choices](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)\n- [Thread: Ushering in an Era of Connectivity](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Thread-Ushering-in-Era-of-Connectivity.pdf)\n- [UG103.16: Multiprotocol Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf)\n- [UG103.01: Fundamentals of Wireless Networks](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-01-fundamentals-wireless-network.pdf)"

You can then reveal the token data by setting its value to a text element.\n\nHere is an example of how to do this in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nimport { BasisTheory } from \"@basis-theory/basis-theory-js\";  \n  \nlet bt;  \nlet textElement;  \n  \n(async () => {  \n bt = await new BasisTheory().init(\"<API_KEY>\", { elements: true });  \n  \n textElement = bt.createElement(\"text\", {  \n targetId: \"exampleTextElement\",  \n });  \n  \n await textElement.mount(\"#exampleTextElement\");  \n  \n const reveal = async () => {  \n const session = await bt.sessions.create();  \n  \n await fetch(\"http://localhost:4242/authorize\", {  \n method: \"POST\",  \n headers: {  \n \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",  \n },  \n body: JSON.stringify({ nonce: session.nonce }),  \n });  \n  \n const token = await bt.tokens.retrieve(\"token_id_1234567890\", {  \n apiKey: session.sessionKey,  \n });  \n  \n textElement.setValue(token.data);  \n };  \n})();\n```\n\nPlease replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key and `\"token_id_1234567890\"` with your actual token ID.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Reveal Tokenized Data](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/guides/share/reveal-tokenized-data) guide in the Basis Theory documentation."

You can adjust these settings as per your requirements. For example, you can set the `clientMetricsMaxPerMinute`, `clientRegisterMaxPerMinute`, `frontendMetricsMaxPerMinute`, and `frontendRegisterMaxPerMinute` among others. These settings are overridable with environment variables like `REGISTER_CLIENT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `CLIENT_METRICS_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `FRONTEND_METRICS_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, and `REGISTER_FRONTEND_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` respectively. [Source](https://docs.getunleash.io/using-unleash/deploy/configuring-unleash#further-customization)\n\n2. **Unleash Edge**: If you're dealing with high traffic loads, you might consider using Unleash Edge. It can help resolve issues related to scaling and high number of transactions per second. [Source](https://www.getunleash.io/blog/from-the-community-how-my-team-uses-unleash-edge-to-handle-high-traffic-loads)\n\n3. **Unleash Proxy**: You can scale the Unleash Proxy independently of the Unleash server to support any number of front-end clients without overloading your Unleash instance. [Source](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/blob/main/README.md)\n\n4. **Managing Constraints**: Be mindful of the cost of data. As the number of elements in a constraint list grows, so does the size of the HTTP response from the Unleash instance. More data to transmit means more bandwidth used and longer response times. More data to parse on the SDK side means more time spent processing and more data to store and look up on the client. [Source](https://docs.getunleash.io/understanding-unleash/managing-constraints#the-cost-of-data)\n\nRemember, if you're calling a large number of flags in your application, you may need to reconsider your approach. Unleash is highly scalable and can handle trillions of flags daily, but excessive flag calling could indicate a problem in your application design.

      "answer": "Astro allows you to create custom endpoints to serve any kind of data, including handling POST requests. However, the knowledge sources provided do not contain specific information on how to save the payload of a POST request as a file in an Astro endpoint.\n\nHere's a general approach based on the information available:\n\n1. Create a `.js` or `.ts` file in the `/pages` directory. This will serve as your custom endpoint. For example, `src/pages/api/upload.ts`.\n\n2. In this file, you can define a function to handle POST requests. This function will receive a context object that includes the request data.\n\n3. From the request data, you can extract the payload. If the payload is a file, you can use the `arrayBuffer()` method to read the file data.\n\n4. Once you have the file data, you can write it to a file using Node.js file system (`fs`) module.\n\nHere's a simplified example based on the information available:\n\n```ts\nimport type { APIContext } from \"astro\";\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\n\nexport async function post({ request }: APIContext) {\n    const data = await request.formData();\n    const file = data.get(\"file\") as File;\n\n    if (file) {\n        const buffer = await file.arrayBuffer();\n        fs.writeFile(path.join(__dirname, 'your-file-name'), buffer, (err) => {\n            if (err) throw err;\n            console.log('File saved successfully');\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and may not work as expected.

Download the latest version of your theme from the Shopify theme store [here](https://themes.shopify.com/themes?q=Archetype). It will be installed in your theme library as an unpublished theme.\n\n2. To copy all your sections and settings over from your old theme, open the code editor for your old theme (Ellipse button > Edit code), find the Config folder from the sidebar and copy everything from settings_data.json\n\n3. Now open the code editor for the new version of the theme and paste everything into the same file, Config/settings_data.json, and Save the file.\n\nIf you're on a newer theme version that supports Online Store 2.0, you can copy over your homepage sections by opening the code editor for your old theme and copy everything from templates/index.json and pasting into the same file in the new theme version.\n\nFor Online Store 2.0 themes, you can also copy over the templates for pages, products, and collections by copying over the contents of the JSON template for each and pasting the contents of those files into the same file in the new theme version.\n\nCustom templates can be brought over using the exact same process, however, you'll need to create the JSON template in the new theme files since they won't exist there by default. More details [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/templates#create-a-new-template) from Shopify on creating new templates in the new theme.\n\nPlease note that if you've installed any apps or made any other code customizations, you'll now want to make those code changes to the new theme as well. If you're on an older theme version that doesn't support Online Store 2.0, homepage sections and product templates will need to be created in the new theme manually.\n\nWhen you're ready to go live, Publish the theme.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2767) of this information."

      "question": "how to use cycloneDX",
      "answer": "CycloneDX is a comprehensive software bill of materials (SBOM) standard that can be used to generate an SBOM from your source code. It is designed to bolster security across software supply chains and is celebrated for its lightweight nature, fostering an environment where adoption and integration into build pipelines are both seamless and efficient. \n\nTo use CycloneDX with Sonatype, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate an SBOM from your source code using CycloneDX. This will get a list of the declared and transitive dependencies referenced in your code. CycloneDX tools can be used as a part of your build process.\n\n2. Once the SBOM is generated, it can be included in your Sonatype evaluation. Sonatype's analyzers will combine these results with anything discovered in your code to get a complete bill of material for your application.\n\n3. If you are using Sonatype's Nexus Repository Manager, you can manage the repositories by logging in as the administrative user and clicking on Repositories in the Views/Repositories menu in the left-hand main menu.\n\n4. Sonatype Lifecycle analysis has expanded support of the CycloneDX v1.5 standard. An SBOM is a list of all packages and libraries included in your application. It’s the digital equivalent of a manufacturing bill of materials. Just as a bill of materials includes all sub-assemblies, the SBOM also includes transitive dependencies or your components’ dependencies. The SBOM makes it easy to see if any risky packages are included in an application.\n\n5. Users can export every report as a Cyclone DX SBOM in either an XML or JSON format. Sonatype has utilized the Cyclone DX standard to create an API that provides users with an easy way to integrate and share SBOMs between other Sonatype products and completely different systems.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the official [Sonatype documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/en/cyclonedx.html) and [CycloneDX tool center](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/)."

Therefore, it is recommended to connect the VBUS pin to the USB+5V to ensure proper operation of the USB peripheral[^98812^].\n\nIn the context of the SYSREG system regulator, when VBUS is disconnected, SYSREG ensures the device enters an Ultra-Low Power mode to minimize quiescent current[^96231^].

      "question": "why is my focus out event not triggered?",
      "answer": "There could be several reasons why your `focusout` event is not being triggered in Toddle. Here are a few things you could check based on the information provided in the knowledge sources:\n\n1. **Check your element type**: If your element is an input, you can use events like `Blur`. If it's not an input, you might need to use a different approach. For example, you could have a sibling div in the same component that comes before the element being clicked out of. This div should have its position set to `Fixed` with top, left, right, and bottom distance set to `0px`. You can then create a click event on this div that triggers an event and then use that on the page ([source](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1174489765257691136)).\n\n2. **Check your event setup**: Make sure that your `focusout` event is set up correctly. If you're using a button to trigger the `focus` event, ensure that the `focus` step in the workflow is focusing on the correct element. If the `focus` step is not focusing the popover, it might not show up ([source](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1174958440003686410)).\n\n3. **Check your element hierarchy**: If the element you're trying to focus on is a child of another element, it might not trigger the `focusout` event as expected. Try moving the child element outside and below the parent element in the element tree ([source](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1174489765257691136)).\n\nIf you're still having trouble, it might be helpful to share your setup with the Toddle community or support staff for more specific guidance."

      "question": "What is Temporal?",
      "answer": "Temporal is a developer-first, open-source platform that ensures the successful execution of services and applications. It is a workflow system that allows developers to write workflows in code, which run in any number of workers. The code in a workflow translates to events in Temporal, meaning the workflow code can be replayed with the events on different workers as needed in an Event Sourcing approach. Therefore, workflow code must be deterministic in order to safely rerun.\n\nTemporal was originally developed at Uber and is now used by various companies for different use cases. It provides a framework to organize long-running and asynchronous code, replacing ad hoc mixes of endpoints, queues, state machines, and schedulers. Temporal works by having an entry point that triggers work in the Temporal server, which is executed by a fleet of workers.\n\nTemporal offers workflows as code, which allows developers to use general-purpose programming languages and familiar tooling. It aims to address the common requirements of complex workloads, such as dynamic logic, standardizing timeouts and retries, reliability, and scalability. It also provides benefits such as observability, testability, and migration capabilities.\n\nTemporal doesn't execute application code at all. Instead, it orchestrates the execution of your code in order to drive workflows to completion. Application code leverages Temporal via the client SDKs. Temporal \"injects\" steps of execution (known as tasks) into application code and can run (and, if necessary, rerun) those steps to overcome intermittent failures of outgoing calls and to recover from infrastructure failures.\n\nSources:\n- [Learn Temporal](https://learn.temporal.io)\n- [Intro to Temporal Blog](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop)\n- [YouTube: Temporal in 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HjnQlnA5eY)\n- [YouTube: Intro to Temporal with TypeScript SDK + Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66zQ8nrW-mA)\n- [Blog: Architecture Part 1](https://temporal.io/blog/sergey-inversion-of-execution)\n- [Blog: The Distributed Machine](https://temporal.io/blog/the-distributed-machine)"

CockroachDB combines the benefits of the relational database model with native support for distributed cloud architecture. It pairs the transactional consistency of standard SQL with elastic scalability, multiregion and multicloud deployment, and high levels of fault tolerance and availability. \n\nCockroachDB is inspired by Google's Spanner and F1 technologies and is designed to scale horizontally, survive disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention. It supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions and provides a familiar SQL API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data. \n\nCockroachDB also offers a new architecture based on clusters of symmetrical nodes that communicate with each other to replicate, rebalance, and repair themselves. This creates a self-healing elastic data layer that spans data centers and cloud providers. CockroachDB can automatically move data closer to active users, pin certain data types to specific locations, and enable no-downtime migrations between cloud providers. It also provides an industry-standard SQL interface with a distributed query engine, allowing for scaling out without compromising ACID transactions.\n\nSources:\n- [CockroachDB The Definitive Guide](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/thank-you/?pdf=/pdf/the-definitive-guide-to-cockroachdb-oreilly.pdf)\n- [Introduction to Serverless Databases and CockroachDB Serverless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLdOEIAe00s)\n- [CockroachDB Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ)\n- [Why CockroachDB?](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/why-cockroachdb)\n\n> Since you're experimenting with CockroachDB, it might be helpful to talk to our sales team who can provide more insights and help you make the most out of CockroachDB.

      "answer": "To start a Temporal workflow from the CLI when the input requires an object, you can use the `temporal workflow start` or `temporal workflow execute` command. You need to specify the workflow type, task queue, and the input object in JSON format. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\ntemporal workflow start --task-queue=MyTaskQueue --type=MyWorkflow --input='{\"JSON\": \"Input\"}'\n```\n\nOr if you want to execute a workflow and print its progress:\n\n```bash\ntemporal workflow execute --workflow-id=meaningful-business-id --type=MyWorkflow --task-queue=MyTaskQueue --input='{\"JSON\": \"Input\"}'\n```\n\nIn these examples, replace `MyTaskQueue` with your task queue, `MyWorkflow` with your workflow type, and `{\"JSON\": \"Input\"}` with your input object in JSON format.\n\nYou can also provide additional options to the command to change how the workflow execution behaves. For example, you can specify the namespace with the `--namespace` option, or set a timeout for the execution with the `--execution-timeout` option. For a full list of options, refer to the [Temporal CLI workflow command reference](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow#start).\n\nPlease note that if you are operating with the Temporal Cloud or self-hosted environments, you need to provide additional options to the command.\n\nSources:\n- [Start Workflow using the CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#start-workflow)\n- [Temporal CLI workflow command reference](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow)\n- [Temporal CLI workflow execute command](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow#execute)\n- [Temporal CLI workflow start command](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow#start)"

      "answer": "In Godot, the `@onready` keyword is used to delay the initialization of a variable until the `_ready()` function is called. This is useful when you want to get a node that might not be available during the script initialization.\n\nIf your `@onready var movement_target = %Vehicle` is returning null, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The `Vehicle` node might not be available at the time the script is initialized. Make sure that the `Vehicle` node is indeed in the same scene and is initialized before the script runs.\n\n2. The node path might be incorrect. In Godot, you can use the `get_node()` function to get a reference to a node. This function supports paths, similar to working with a file browser. You can use a slash to separate nodes. For example, if your `Vehicle` node is a child of another node called `ParentNode`, you would use `get_node(\"ParentNode/Vehicle\")` to get the `Vehicle` node.\n\nHere's an example from the [knowledge source](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.html):\n\n```gdscript\nvar vehicle_node\n\nfunc _ready():\n vehicle_node = get_node(\"Vehicle\")\n```\n\n3. If the `Vehicle` node is not a direct child of the node the script is attached to, you would need to use the correct path to reference it. For example, if the `Vehicle` node is a child of a `ParentNode`, you would use `get_node(\"ParentNode/Vehicle\")`.\n\n4. If you're still having trouble, you might want to check if there's a typo in the node name. Node names are case-sensitive, so `Vehicle` is different from `vehicle`.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it might be helpful to provide more information about your scene tree and the script you're using."

Installing the Simplicity Studio for VS Code extension will also install other extensions it depends on: C++ Extension Pack and Cortex-Debug.\n\n3. **Create a Project in Simplicity Studio**: Simplicity Studio is still needed to create the initial project and to make project changes with the Project Configurator GUIs. When creating a new project, you can set the target generator in the new project wizard on step 1 to VS Code. For existing projects, from the Project Configurator Overview tab, click Change Target/SDK/Generators and select the VS Code generator.\n\n4. **Add the Project to VS Code**: You can add a project to VS Code in two ways. Use File > Open Folder… and browse to the project folder in the Simplicity Studio workspace (default workspace is v5_workspace) or the source-controlled project folder. Or use File > Add Folder to Workspace… and again browse to the project folder. This second method is recommended, especially if working with multiple projects.\n\n5. **Build, Flash, and Debug**: Once the project is added to VS Code, you can build, flash, and debug the project within VS Code. The 'SILICON LABS SUPPORT' section in VS Code will be populated with project related actions. The 'Build' icon will use 'make' along with the two generated make files and the GNU ARM GCC toolchain specified when the project was created in Simplicity Studio. The 'Flash' icon will flash the project .hex file to the target board using Simplicity Commander. The 'Debug' icon will start a debug session using the Segger GDB Server and the GNU ARM GDB Client.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-vscode-ide) or watch the tutorial videos on Silicon Labs' YouTube channel: [Quick Start: Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X92GLiHeeU) and [Simplicity Studio for VS Code Extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7QrO09OPZc)."

      "question": "Why is my Device connectivity status sometimes not correct?",
      "answer": "There could be several reasons why your device connectivity status is not reflecting correctly. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. **Device State:** The device state can be determined by looking at the device's details. The state could be \"Attached\", \"Blocked\", \"Offline\", or \"Online\". If the device has successfully attached to the Emnify Core Network in the past, its state is displayed as \"Attached\" until the visited network has signaled that the device is inactive/offline. This usually happens within 1-2 days after a device has gone offline. If the service is suspended due to exceeded traffic limits or IMEI lock, the state will be \"Blocked\". If a network connection isn't possible, the state will be \"Offline\". If a network connection is active, and the device can use data and SMS per the device policies, the state will be \"Online\".[^1^]\n\n2. **PDP Context:** The most efficient way to see if your device has connectivity is to look for the \"PDP Context active 00:00:00\" display that refreshes every 20 seconds in the \"Connection\" section of \"Device Details\". If it's present and the active time (shown in hh:mm:ss format) increases with each refresh, then you know your device is connected to the network. If a device's most recent PDP context event is \"Create PDP Context\", the device should be online with an active network connection. The device is offline if a device's most recent PDP context event is \"Delete PDP Context\".[^1^]\n\n3. **Device Shows Attached but Doesn't Transmit Data:** The \"Attached\" status doesn't necessarily mean that the device is powered on. If the device first attaches to a network and then powers off, there is no information towards the Emnify network that would allow detecting this.[^2^]\n\n4. **Reset Connectivity:** Power cycling (power down and back up again) is different from reset in the portal. The Reset connectivity in the user interface performs a Network Initiated reset. This sends a Cancel Location message from the platform to the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) where the device was (or is) registered to. Thus, the next time this station sees the device, an update location is required by the network.[^3^]\n\n5. **Configuration Changes:** After configuration changes, make sure they're correctly applied on the device (for example, with a reboot). Clicking the reset connectivity icon on \"Connected Devices\" can also reset the network state and allow your device to freshly reattach.[^4^]\n\n[^1^]: [Device Troubleshooting](https://docs.emnify.com/portal/troubleshooting)\n[^2^]: [The device shows attached but doesn't transmit data](https://docs.emnify.com/quickstart/troubleshooting#the-device-shows-attached-but-doesnt-transmit-data)\n[^3^]: [AT Commands: Introduction, commands for a proper network connection/disconnection and device configuration examples](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401884056466-AT-Commands-Introduction-commands-for-a-proper-network-connection-disconnection-and-device-configuration-examples#h_01F7JNH34W338PJ8HMA7AKBERR)\n[^4^]: [Other general troubleshooting tips](https://docs.emnify.com/quickstart/troubleshooting#other-general-troubleshooting-tips)"

      "answer": "The phrase \"Remove the roundID check, just rely on the timestamp check logic\" likely refers to the process of validating data in the context of Chainlink's decentralized oracle network. \n\nIn the provided knowledge sources, there are several instances where both round IDs and timestamps are used to validate and verify data. For example, in the process of obtaining historical cryptocurrency price data using Chainlink Price Feeds, the system checks the round IDs and timestamps to ensure the accuracy and validity of the data. \n\nHere is an example of a timestamp check from the provided sources:\n```javascript\n//next, make sure prev round is before timestamp that was searched, and next round is after\nrequire(previousPriceTimestamp < searchTimestamp, \"Previous price timetamp must be < search timestamp\");\nrequire(searchTimestamp < nextPriceTimestamp, \"Search timetamp must be < next round timestamp\");\nrequire(priceTimestamp <= searchTimestamp, \"Answer timetamp must be less than or equal to searchTimestamp timestamp\");\n```\n(Source: [Chainlink Blog](https://blog.chain.link/historical-cryptocurrency-price-data#post-title))\n\nIn this context, \"Remove the roundID check, just rely on the timestamp check logic\" could mean to eliminate the validation steps that involve checking the round IDs, and instead only use the steps that involve checking the timestamps. However, it's important to note that both round IDs and timestamps play crucial roles in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data in Chainlink's system. Removing any of these checks could potentially impact the system's ability to correctly validate and verify data."

      "answer": "In Refine, you can use the `meta` property in your resources to pass GraphQL queries or mutations to your data provider methods through data hooks like `useOne`, `useList`, `useForm` from anywhere across your application. The `meta` property has `gqlQuery` and `gqlMutation` fields, which accept GraphQL operations as `graphql`'s `DocumentNode` type.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```jsx\nimport gql from \"graphql-tag\";  \nimport { useOne, useUpdate } from \"@refinedev/core\";  \n  \nconst GET_PRODUCT_QUERY = gql`  \n query GetProduct($id: ID!) {  \n product(id: $id) {  \n id  \n title  \n category {  \n title  \n }  \n }  \n }  \n`;  \n  \nuseOne({  \n resource: \"products\",  \n id: 1,  \n meta: {  \n gqlQuery: GET_PRODUCT_QUERY,  \n },  \n});  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `GET_PRODUCT_QUERY` is passed to the `useOne` hook via the `meta` property. This allows you to define custom queries for your needs.\n\nYou can also use the `meta` property to specify the fields you want to select when making requests. For instance, when sending the request, you specify which fields will come, so you send fields in `meta` to hooks that you will fetch data from.\n\n```jsx\nconst { tableProps, sorter } = useTable<IPost>({  \n sorters: {  \n initial: [  \n {  \n field: \"id\",  \n order: \"asc\",  \n },  \n ],  \n },  \n meta: {  \n fields: [  \n \"id\",  \n \"title\",  \n {  \n category: [\"title\"],  \n },  \n ],  \n },  \n});  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `fields` property in `meta` is used to specify the fields to be fetched from the \"posts\" resource.\n\nFor more detailed usage, you can refer to the [Refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/data-fetching#graphql) and the [Nest.js Query Docs](https://refine.dev/docs/data/packages/nestjs-query/)."

We are storing quite a bit of info in them. Scalability is not an issue now but we are worried that in the future the size of the payload may start causing issues.\n\nWill we run into a hard size limit of the payload?\n\nMy goal is to determine how soon we should start the process of putting the config into a more appropriate system\n\n I have read these 2 articles:\n\n1. <https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads>\n2. <https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/short-lived-feature-flags>",
      "answer": "Hello! It's great to hear that you're using Unleash for feature flagging. You're correct in your concern about the size of the payload. While there may not be a hard size limit, it's recommended to keep the feature flag payload as small as possible for several reasons:\n\n1. **Reduced Network Load**: Large payloads can lead to increased network traffic between the application and the feature flagging service, potentially causing bottlenecks and slow response times [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n2. **Faster Evaluation**: Smaller payloads reduce latency, allowing your application to respond promptly to feature flag changes [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n3. **Improved Memory Efficiency**: Larger payloads consume more memory, potentially causing memory exhaustion and system crashes [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n4. **Scalability**: Smaller payloads require fewer resources for processing, making it easier to scale your system horizontally [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n5. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: When payloads are limited, the infrastructure required to support the feature flagging system can be smaller and less costly [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n6. **Reliability**: A feature flagging system that consistently delivers small, manageable payloads is more likely to be reliable [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\n7. **Ease of Monitoring and Debugging**: Smaller payloads are easier to monitor and debug [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads)].\n\nAs for the confusion between feature flags and application configuration, it's recommended to make feature flags short-lived and not to confuse them with application configuration [[source](https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/short-lived-feature-flags)]. \n\nSo, it would be a good idea to start the process of moving the configuration to a more appropriate system sooner rather than later. This will help you maintain the efficiency and performance of your feature flag system."

      "answer": "Yes, metadata tags can be prefixed with `metadata_` when you are passing them in a CSV file. However, it's not mandatory to prefix them with `metadata_`. If you have a column name prefixed with `metadata_` in your CSV file but you’ve also selected a regular column to be used as metadata for your mailpiece, then the values from the `metadata_` prefixed column will not be used. Lob prioritizes the manually selected columns to be attached as metadata. If you have not manually selected any column from your CSV file to be used as metadata and the CSV file contains a `metadata_` prefixed column, then the data from the `metadata_` prefixed columns will be used as metadata for each mailpiece automatically. Column names prefixed with `metadata_` do not need to be manually selected as metadata. They are automatically applied. If you would like to manually select this column, then simply remove the `metadata_` prefix from the column name. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Lob documentation](https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/reaching-your-audience/campaign-audience-guide#metadata-columns)."

      "answer": "No, if a vulnerable package is already cached inside the firewall enabled proxy repository, it will not get quarantined if the same package is found to be vulnerable at a later time. The firewall rules are only applied at the time a component is entering the proxy repository's cache. Once a component is cached in a proxy repository in a non-quarantined state, it will not be quarantined again unless it is deleted and re-downloaded. This ensures that turning on quarantine will not break your existing builds [source](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/64567).\n\nHowever, you can trigger a \"Re-evaluate Policy\" for the proxy repository on demand. This is useful especially after an associated policy is added or modified on IQ Server.

      "question": "how would you initialize a ray serve deployment by putting a large model in the object store?",
      "answer": "To initialize a Ray Serve deployment with a large model, you would typically load the model in the `__init__` function of your deployment. However, if the model is too large and takes a long time to load, Ray might constantly tear down and recreate the deployment, as it might interpret the long loading time as a failure.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided knowledge sources do not contain specific information on how to increase the time allowed to load a model in the `__init__` function of a deployment or how to put a large model in the Ray object store during the initialization of a Ray Serve deployment.\n\nHowever, Ray Serve does support a feature called model multiplexing, which allows you to serve multiple models within a single deployment. This could potentially be used to load models in a more efficient way. Here is an example of how to define a multiplexed deployment:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\nimport aioboto3\nimport torch\nimport starlette\n\n@serve.deployment\nclass ModelInferencer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bucket_name = \"my_bucket\"\n\n    @serve.multiplexed(max_num_models_per_replica=3)\n    async def get_model(self, model_id: str):\n        session = aioboto3.Session()\n        async with session.resource(\"s3\") as s3:\n            obj = await s3.Bucket(self.bucket_name)\n            await obj.download_file(f\"{model_id}/model.pt\", f\"model_{model_id}.pt\")\n            return torch.load(f\"model_{model_id}.pt\")\n\n    async def __call__(self, request: starlette.requests.Request):\n        model_id = serve.get_multiplexed_model_id()\n        model = await self.get_model(model_id)\n        return model.forward(torch.rand(64, 3, 512, 512))\n\nentry = ModelInferencer.bind()\n```\nIn this example, the `get_model` method is decorated with `@serve.multiplexed(max_num_models_per_replica=3)`, which means that each replica of the deployment can serve up to 3 different models. The models are loaded from an S3 bucket and stored in the local file system of the replica. The `__call__` method uses the `serve.get_multiplexed_model_id()` function to get the ID of the model to use for a particular request, and then calls the `get_model` method to load the model.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example and might not directly solve your problem. For more detailed information, you might want to check the [Ray Serve documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) or ask your question in the [Ray community forum](https://discuss.ray.io/).\n\n[Source](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/model-multiplexing.html)"

The `portalContainer` prop is used to specify the container element in which the navbar menu overlay portal will be placed. The `motionProps` prop is used to control the `open` / `close` animation.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `NavbarMenu` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Navbar,  NavbarBrand,  NavbarContent,  NavbarItem,  NavbarMenuToggle, NavbarMenu, NavbarMenuItem} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\n\n// ...\n\n<NavbarMenu>\n  <NavbarMenuItem>\n    // Your menu item here\n  </NavbarMenuItem>\n  // More menu items...\n</NavbarMenu>\n```\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://nextui.org/docs/components/navbar#usage)."

      "answer": "You can customize the primary color in NextUI by modifying your `tailwind.config.js` file. Here's an example of how you can modify the primary and focus colors of the dark theme:\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst {nextui} = require(\"@nextui-org/react\");\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    nextui({\n      themes: {\n        dark: {\n          colors: {\n            primary: {\n              DEFAULT: \"#BEF264\",\n              foreground: \"#000000\",\n            },\n            focus: \"#BEF264\",\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nThis modification will impact all components using the `primary` color. For instance, the Button component uses the `primary` color as background color when the variant is `solid` or `ghost`.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Button} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n      <Button color=\"primary\" variant=\"solid\">Solid</Button>\n      <Button color=\"primary\" variant=\"ghost\">Ghost</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFor more details about the available semantic colors and color tokens, you can refer to the [Colors section](https://nextui.org/docs/customization/colors) in the NextUI documentation.\n\nSource: [NextUI Docs - Customize Theme](https://nextui.org/docs/customization/customize-theme#customizing-colors)"

      "answer": "To refetch data after an update during `useTable`, you can use the `refetch` method from `tableQueryResult` returned by `useTable`. However, if you want to control the refetching manually, you can use a state variable and the `queryOptions` property of `useTable`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do it:\n\n1. Create an initial state:\n```tsx\nconst [doRefetch, setDoRefetch] = useState(false);\n```\n\n2. Use `queryOptions` in `useTable`:\n```tsx\nconst {\n  tableProps,\n  formProps,\n  sorter,\n  searchFormProps,\n} = useTable({\n    ...\n    queryOptions: {\n      enabled: doRefetch // use doRefetch state\n    }\n  })\n```\n\n3. Prepare for fetch on mount:\n```tsx\nconst refetchQuery = useCallback(() => {\n setDoRefetch(true)\n\n // Change state after process done\n // You can change to default value after get data\n // Make sure the request done and success.\n setTimeout(() => setDoRefetch(false), 50)\n}, [])\n\n// Fetch when mount, only first time\nuseEffect(refetchQuery, [])\n```\n\n4. Use in some event, for example:\n```tsx\n<DeleteButton\n  ...\n  hideText\n  size=\"small\"\n  recordItemId={record.Username}\n  onSuccess={refetchQuery}\n/>\n```\n\nWhen the delete is successful, call `refetchQuery` and `useTable` will do a re-call (refetch).\n\nPlease note that Refine automatically invalidates the affected resources after mutations. However, in some cases, you may want to refetch manually. You can use the `refetch` function provided by all \"data\" related hooks in Refine or the `useInvalidate` hook for this purpose.\n\nSources:\n- [Github Issue (closed): [FEAT] Do Refetch in useEditableTable or useTable](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/1512)\n- [Documentation > Docs > Guides-concepts > Frequently Asked Questions > How can I refetch data?](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/faq#how-can-i-refetch-data)\n- [Documentation > Docs > Data > Hooks > useTable > Properties > queryOptions](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-table#queryoptions)"

Here are some steps you can follow to debug this issue:\n\n1. **Check the `sharp` module in your Lambda Layer**: According to the [tutorial on how to automatically resize images with serverless](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-automatically-resize-images-with-serverless.html#using-sharp-as-a-layer), you should have a `sharp` module in your Lambda Layer. Make sure that you have downloaded the latest `sharp-lambda-layer.zip` from the [releases](https://github.com/Umkus/lambda-layer-sharp/releases) and unzipped it into the `layers/sharp` directory. The path should look something like `layers/sharp/nodejs/node_modules`.\n\n2. **Use the Live Lambda Development environment**: SST features a [Live Lambda Development](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development) environment that allows you to debug and test your Lambda functions locally. You can start this environment by running `npm run dev`. This will deploy your app and a debug stack to power the Live Lambda Development environment. \n\n3. **Debug with your IDE**: If you're using Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or WebStorm, you can set breakpoints in your code and start the Live Lambda Development environment to debug your Lambda functions. Here are the guides for [debugging with Visual Studio Code](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-debug-lambda-functions-with-visual-studio-code.html#starting-your-dev-environment), [debugging with IntelliJ IDEA](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-debug-lambda-functions-with-intellij-idea.html#starting-your-dev-environment), and [debugging with WebStorm](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-debug-lambda-functions-with-webstorm.html#starting-your-dev-environment).\n\nRemember, the first time you start the Live Lambda Development environment, it’ll take a couple of minutes to bootstrap your AWS environment to use CDK, deploy a debug stack, deploy your app, and start up a local client.\n\nIf you're still having issues after following these steps, it might be helpful to look at the specific error messages you're getting when trying to load the `sharp` module.

      "answer": "Stopping and terminating a Pod in RunPod serve different purposes and have different implications.\n\nWhen you **stop a Pod**, it essentially pauses the Pod's operations but retains the Pod's state and data. This is useful when you want to temporarily halt the Pod's activities but plan to resume them later without losing any data or state. However, it's important to note that you are still charged for storing idle Pods, even when they are stopped. To stop a Pod, you can use the web interface or the command line with the following command: `runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID`. You can also set a Pod to stop after a specific amount of time using commands provided in the [documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/manage-pods#stop-a-pod).\n\nOn the other hand, **terminating a Pod** permanently deletes all data outside your network volume. This means that any data you haven't saved to your network volume will be lost. This is useful when you no longer need the Pod and want to free up resources. However, once a Pod is terminated, it cannot be recovered. To terminate a Pod, you can use the web interface or the command line with the following command: `runpodctl remove pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID`. More details on how to terminate a Pod can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/manage-pods#terminate-a-pod).\n\nIn summary, you would stop a Pod when you want to temporarily pause its operations but plan to resume them later, and you would terminate a Pod when you no longer need it and want to permanently delete it."

      "answer": "To deploy a Vite React app using SST Ion, you would use the `sst.aws.StaticSite` component. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Define your Vite React app in your `sst.config.ts` file. You can set environment variables for the build process of your static site. These will be used locally and on deploy. For Vite, the types for the environment variables are also generated. This can be configured through the `vite` prop. For some static site generators like Vite, environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` can be accessed in the browser. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst myBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket(\"MyBucket\");\nnew sst.aws.StaticSite(\"MyWeb\", { \n  environment: { \n    BUCKET_NAME: myBucket.name, // Accessible in the browser \n    VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: \"pk_test_123\" \n  }, \n  build: { \n    command: \"npm run build\", \n    output: \"dist\" \n  }\n});\n```\n2. Use the `sst deploy` command to deploy your application. By default, it deploys to your personal stage. Optionally, you can deploy your app to a specific stage using `sst deploy --stage=production`.\n\n```bash\nsst deploy\n```\nor\n```bash\nsst deploy --stage=production\n```\nPlease note that Ion is currently in alpha and supports Node.js applications on macOS, Linux, and WSL. Support for other runtimes and OSes are on the roadmap.\n\nSources:\n- [Deploying your app](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/start/nextjs#5-deploy-your-app)\n- [Setting environment variables](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/component/aws/static-site#set-environment-variables)\n- [Deploying a Vite SPA](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/component/aws/static-site#_top)\n- [Deploy command](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/reference/cli#deploy)"

However, I can provide a general SQL statement using a natural join. A natural join in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Here is a general example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2;\n```\n\nIn this example, `table1` and `table2` would be your sales representatives and addresses tables, respectively. Please replace `table1` and `table2` with your actual table names.\n\nRemember, a natural join automatically matches the columns with the same name in both tables.

This mutation allows you to create a new subitem via the API. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use this mutation:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n create_subitem (parent_item_id: 1234567, item_name: \"new subitem\") {\n id\n board {\n id\n }\n }\n}\n```\n\nIn this mutation, you need to replace `1234567` with the ID of the parent item under which you want to create the subitem. Replace `\"new subitem\"` with the name you want to give to the new subitem.\n\nYou can also specify the column values of the new subitem and whether to create status/dropdown labels if they're missing. Here are the arguments you can use:\n\n| Argument | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| column_values `JSON` | The column values of the new subitem. |\n| create_labels_if_missing `Boolean` | Creates status/dropdown labels if they're missing. Requires permission to change the board structure. |\n| item_name `String!` | The new subitem's name. |\n| parent_item_id `ID!` | The parent item's unique identifier. |\n\nTo run this mutation in Postman, you would need to make a POST request to `https://api.monday.com/v2/` with the GraphQL query in the body. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual data.\n\nPlease note that you need the `boards:write` scope to perform this operation.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [monday.com API documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/subitems)."

      "answer": "To get started with running a Chainlink node, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Docker**: Docker is a tool that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. You can install Docker by running the following commands:\n   ```\n   curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh\n   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n   exit\n   # log in again\n   ```\n   [Source](https://blog.chain.link/easily-sell-your-apis-and-data-to-any-blockchain-via-chainlink#launch-your-data-source-s-chainlink-node-in-10-minutes)\n\n2. **Set up an Ethereum client**: Chainlink nodes require an active connection to an Ethereum client to communicate with smart contracts on the blockchain. You can use either Geth or Parity as your Ethereum client. Here's how you can set up Geth:\n   ```\n   docker pull ethereum/client-go:stable\n   mkdir ~/.geth-ropsten\n   docker run --name eth -p 8546:8546 -v ~/.geth-ropsten:/geth -it ethereum/client-go:stable --testnet --syncmode light --ws --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 --wsorigins=\"*\" --datadir /geth\n   ```\n   [Source](https://blog.chain.link/running-a-chainlink-node-for-the-first-time#post-title)\n\n3. **Run a Chainlink node**: After setting up Docker and an Ethereum client, you can now run a Chainlink node. Here's how you can do it:\n   ```\n   docker pull smartcontract/chainlink:latest\n   mkdir ~/.chainlink-ropsten\n   echo \"ROOT=/chainlink\n   LOG_LEVEL=debug\n   ETH_URL=ws://eth:8546\n   ETH_CHAIN_ID=3\n   MIN_OUTGOING_CONFIRMATIONS=2\n   MIN_INCOMING_CONFIRMATIONS=0\n   LINK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x20fe562d797a42dcb3399062ae9546cd06f63280\n   CHAINLINK_TLS_PORT=0\n   CHAINLINK_DEV=true\n   ALLOW_ORIGINS=*\" > .env\n   ```\n   [Source](https://blog.chain.link/running-a-chainlink-node-for-the-first-time#post-title)\n\nPlease note that these instructions are for running a Chainlink node in a test setting on your local machine.

      "answer": "`findManyArgs` is an argument you can pass to the `findMany` function in Prisma. It allows you to specify various options for your query, such as which fields to select, how to order the results, and more.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use `findManyArgs`:\n\n```ts\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n  select: { name: true, email: true },\n  orderBy: { name: 'asc' },\n  take: 10\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, `findManyArgs` is the object that's passed to `findMany`. It has three properties: `select`, `orderBy`, and `take`.\n\n- `select`: This property is used to specify which fields to include in the returned objects. In this case, only the `name` and `email` fields are included.\n- `orderBy`: This property is used to specify how to order the returned list. In this case, the list is ordered by `name` in ascending order.\n- `take`: This property is used to specify how many objects should be returned in the list. In this case, only the first 10 objects are returned.\n\nYou can find more information about the options you can pass to `findMany` in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany).\n\nPlease note that the actual type of `findManyArgs` will depend on the model you're querying. For example, if you're querying a `User` model, the type would be `UserFindManyArgs`. This type would include all the fields in the `User` model, allowing you to filter, order, and select based on those fields."

      "answer": "To get all items on a board using the monday.com API, you can use cursor-based pagination. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start by running a GraphQL `items_page` query to retrieve the first 500 items from the board. Don't forget to include your board ID as an argument. Here's a sample query:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  boards (ids: 1234567890){\n    items_page {\n      cursor\n      items {\n        id \n        name \n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. This query returns a cursor value and the first 500 items on your board. Using that cursor value as an argument, run a `next_items_page` query to fetch the next relevant set of items. Please keep in mind that each cursor is valid for 60 minutes after the initial request. Here's a sample query:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  next_items_page (cursor: \"MSw5NzI4MDA5MDAsaV9YcmxJb0p1VEdYc1VWeGlxeF9kLDg4MiwzNXw0MTQ1NzU1MTE5\") {\n    cursor\n    items {\n      id\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. This query returns another cursor value and the following 500 items on the board. Repeat the same query using the consecutive cursor values until you have paginated through the entire data set.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [monday.com API reference on querying board items](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/querying-board-items)."

This list includes any (sub)domains you have delegated to Netlify DNS; you can add more at **Team Overview > Domains**.\n5. **Add an optional prefix in the “Additional subdomain”** field. You can have deploys available at `*.internal.yourcompany.com` instead of `*.yourcompany.com`. There is no need to set up any additional DNS records for this.\n6. Press **“Save”**.\n\nNetlify will automatically generate wildcard DNS records and SSL certificates for each Deploy Preview (`deploy-preview–123.internal.yourcompany.com`) and deployed branch (`branch-name.internal.yourcompany.com`). \n\nPlease note that if you use a custom certificate for your site’s domains, that certificate must explicitly include any new subdomains used for automatic deploy subdomains. The standard wildcard syntax, such as `*.company.com`, does not cover this new subdomain. You can learn more about this [here](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/#custom-certificates).\n\nAlso, remember that automatic deploy subdomains require that your production site has at least one custom domain and a Netlify DNS-managed (sub)domain.

      "answer": "Temporal is an open-source runtime for managing distributed application state at scale. It was originally developed at Uber and is now used by various companies like Netflix, Coinbase, and Stripe for different use cases. Temporal aims to address the common requirements of complex workloads, such as dynamic logic, standardizing timeouts and retries, reliability, and scalability. It offers workflows as code, which allows developers to use general-purpose programming languages and familiar tooling. \n\nTemporal is a workflow engine that doesn't execute application code but orchestrates the execution of your code to drive workflows to completion. It works by having an entry point that triggers work in the Temporal server, which is executed by a fleet of workers. The state of the program is fully preserved at all times, meaning if your program restarts or the backend service goes down, your program will be in exactly the same state with all local variables and stack traces in exactly the same state. \n\nTemporal also provides a framework to organize long-running and asynchronous code, replacing ad hoc mixes of endpoints, queues, state machines, and schedulers. It ensures no progress will ever be lost, meaning it will pick up exactly where it left off no matter what, including failures for an unknown length of time. \n\nYou can learn more about Temporal from its [official website](https://temporal.io/), [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HjnQlnA5eY), [blogs](https://temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles), and [hands-on tutorials and courses](https://learn.temporal.io).\n\nSources:\n- [YouTube: Getting Started - Temporal in 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HjnQlnA5eY)\n- [Temporal Blog: Workflow Engine Principles](https://temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles)\n- [Temporal Blog: Stop Building Distributed Systems and Start Building Distributed Applications](https://temporal.io/blog/the-distributed-machine)\n- [Temporal Blog: Architecture Part 1](https://temporal.io/blog/sergey-inversion-of-execution)\n- [YouTube: Getting Started - Intro to Temporal with TypeScript SDK + Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66zQ8nrW-mA)\n- [Temporal Blog: Intro to Temporal](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop)\n- [Temporal Blog: To Choreograph or Orchestrate Your Saga, That Is the Question](https://temporal.io/blog/to-choreograph-or-orchestrate-your-saga-that-is-the-question)\n- [Learn Temporal](https://learn.temporal.io)"

Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\napiKey = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\napiUrl = \"https://api.monday.com/v2\"\nheaders = {\"Authorization\" : apiKey, \"API-Version\" : \"2023-04\"}\n\nquery = 'query { boards (ids: 1234567890){ items_page { cursor items { id name } } } }'\ndata = {'query' : query}\n\nr = requests.post(url=apiUrl, json=data, headers=headers)\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"` with your actual API key. The `query` variable contains a GraphQL query that retrieves the first page of items from the board with the ID `1234567890`. The `requests.post` function sends a POST request to the monday.com API, which returns the requested data.\n\nThe response from the API will be a JSON object that includes the items from the requested page. You can access this data in Python using the `json` module.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `1234567890` with your actual board ID. Also, the API version used in this example is `2023-04`, you might need to use the current API version.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [monday.com API reference](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/getting-started)."

      "question": "in java I need to covernt geojson to simplesystle",
      "answer": "To convert GeoJSON to SimpleStyle in Java, you can use the Mapbox Java SDK's GeoJSON module. This module provides support for GeoJSON, an open standard file format for representing map data. \n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use the GeoJSON module to create a `FeatureCollection` from a GeoJSON string:\n\n```java\nFeatureCollection featureCollection = FeatureCollection.fromJson(stringJson);\n```\n\nYou can then add this `FeatureCollection` to a `GeoJsonSource` and add it to your map's style:\n\n```java\nGeoJsonSource geoJsonSource = new GeoJsonSource(\"line-source\", featureCollection);\nstyle.addSource(geoJsonSource);\n```\n\nYou can also add a `LineLayer` to your map's style and set its properties according to the SimpleStyle specification:\n\n```java\nstyle.addLayer(new LineLayer(\"linelayer\", \"line-source\").withProperties(\n    PropertyFactory.lineDasharray(new Float[] {0.01f, 2f}),\n    PropertyFactory.lineCap(Property.LINE_CAP_ROUND),\n    PropertyFactory.lineJoin(Property.LINE_JOIN_ROUND),\n    PropertyFactory.lineWidth(5f),\n    PropertyFactory.lineColor(Color.parseColor(\"#e55e5e\"))\n));\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Mapbox Java SDK's GeoJSON module documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/java/guides/geojson) and the [Mapbox Android Java Examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/java/examples/simplify-a-polyline)."

      "question": "check session ",
      "answer": "To check if a user is signed in and has an active session in Ory, you can use the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint. The way you check the session depends on whether you're using a browser app or a native app.\n\nFor browser apps, Ory stores session data in Ory Session Cookies. To check for an active session with an Ory Session Cookie, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Cookie: ory_session_...=...\" \\  \n \"https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/sessions/whoami\"  \n```\n\nFor native apps, Ory stores session data in Ory Session Tokens. To check for an active session with an Ory Session Token, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer {your-session-token}\" \\  \n \"https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/sessions/whoami\"  \n```\n\nIf the user doesn't have an active session, the system returns a `401 Unauthorized` response. If the user has an active session, you get a `200 OK` response and the session payload.\n\nWhen using the SDK, you can use the `frontend.toSession()` method to check the session. Here is an example using the TypeScript SDK:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Configuration, FrontendApi } from \"@ory/client\"  \n  \nconst frontend = new FrontendApi(  \n new Configuration({  \n basePath: `https://${process.env.ORY_PROJECT_SLUG}.projects.oryapis.com`,  \n }),  \n)  \n  \nexport async function checkSession(sessionId: string, token: string) {  \n return await frontend.toSession({  \n xSessionToken: token,  \n })  \n}  \n```\n\nSources:\n- [Check session status Part 1](https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/sign-in/check-session-token-cookie-api)\n- [Check session status Part 2](https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/sign-in/check-session-token-cookie-api)\n- [Using Ory Session Token](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/session-management/overview#using-ory-session-token)"

      "answer": "To use Ory Keto, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Installation**: Install Ory Keto on your preferred operating system. For example, on Linux, you can use the following commands:\n\n```bash\nbash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -d -b . keto <version-you-want>  \n./keto help  \n```\n\nThen move Ory Keto to your `$PATH`:\n\n```bash\nsudo mv ./keto /usr/local/bin/  \nketo help  \n```\n\nFor other operating systems, refer to the [installation guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/install).\n\n2. **Integration**: Learn how to integrate Ory Permissions into your application architecture. This can be done whether you're building a new application from scratch or adding access control to an existing one. More details can be found in the [integration guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/guides/simple-access-check-guide).\n\n3. **SDK**: Use the Ory Keto SDK for integration with a self-hosted Ory Keto Permission Server. Before using the SDK, consult the Ory Keto [REST](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/reference/rest-api) and [gRPC](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/reference/proto-api) API documentation. The SDKs are available for various programming languages, which can be found [here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/sdk/overview#download-the-sdk).\n\n4. **Configuration**: Use the Ory CLI to adjust the configuration of Ory Permissions and apply config from the Ory Network environment to self-hosted Ory Keto instances. You can export the configuration from Ory Network and import it to your local setup. More details can be found in the [configuration guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/configure-permission-service).\n\n5. **Prepare for Production**: When you're ready to move to production, ensure you have a production-grade database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or CockroachDB. It's also recommended to run Ory Keto behind an API gateway or a load balancer. More details can be found in the [production guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/guides/production).\n\nRemember, if you need help, you can reach out to the community on [Ory Community Slack](http://slack.ory.sh/)."

You can create a template from a deployed stack. To do this, select **Stacks** from the menu, choose the already-deployed stack, then click **Create template from stack**. You can then define properties for the new template and make any necessary changes in the **Web editor**. When you're ready, click **Create custom template** ([source](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks/template)).\n2. Custom templates support the use of variables for further customization of the deployed stack. Variables are identified in stacks with `{{ }}`. When a variable is defined, options appear to customize how the variable appears when deploying the stack. You can set the **label**, **description**, and **default value** ([source](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/templates/custom#variables-in-templates)).\n\nFor Kubernetes:\n1. Portainer BE 2.10 added custom template support for Kubernetes environments. You can create templates based on Kubernetes manifests for future deployment. From the menu, select **Custom Templates** to view a list of custom templates you've already created. You can create a new template, edit an existing one, or remove a template if you no longer need it ([source](https://docs.portainer.io/user/kubernetes/templates)).\n\nIf you encounter issues with the template editor, such as the inability to create containers or stacks, a workaround has been suggested by a user on GitHub. In a Chromium-based web browser, right-click on the disabled Create Custom Template button and select *Inspect* from the context menu. In the Dev tool for the web browser, remove the 'Disabled=Disabled' attribute at the end of it. The button should then become active ([source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/7321))."

      "answer": "To build a Matter application for a custom board using Silicon Labs Matter Github (SMG), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Matter Solution**: Go to the \"Example Project Selection\" section of Simplicity Studio's \"New Project Wizard\". Ensure \"Example Projects\" is turned off, \"Solution Examples\" is turned on, and \"Matter\" under the \"Technology\" section is checked. Then, select the application example you wish to create a project from. [source](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/latest/matter-overview-guides/matter-solutions)\n\n2. **Develop the Application**: Develop your application for the custom board. Once this is done, it is necessary to build the application. The command to build with SMG 2.1.1-1.1 for the led-strip project is as follows:\n```zsh\n./scripts/examples/gn_efr32_example.sh ./project/led-strip/efr32 ./out/led-strip BRD4187c show_qr_code=false disable_lcd=true chip_detail_logging=true is_debug=true chip_openthread_ftd=true enable_openthread_cli=false segger_rtt_buffer_size_up=4096\n```\nThese building arguments disable the cli openthread which is used by the USART, increase the RTT buffer to have access to all the logs without any issues. It also enables the full logging features for better tracking as part of the example. [source](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter_applications/blob/master/matter_thread_custom_cluster/README.md)\n\n3. **Compile the Project and Upload to Test Board**: From the contextual menu of the project in Simplicity Studio, select *Build Project*. Open up the *Simplicity Commander* tool from *Simplicity Studio*. Choose the board you wish to work on; they are identified by a unique serial number. Go to the *Flash* section and clear the flash of the test device to ensure the removal of any previous testing, commissioning data, etc. Upload a pre-compiled bootloader firmware binary and the firmware binary of the test project. [source](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter_applications/blob/master/matter_thread_ww2023_mat-204_lock_light_mad/README.md)\n\nPlease note that you should have a good understanding of the Matter fundamentals and the Matter Developer's Guide, which provides detailed background and instructions for Matter developers working in either the Thread or Wi-Fi models. [source](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/latest/matter-device-dev-prereqs)\n\nAlso, ensure that you have the correct version of the GCC compiler for your SMG version.

This API can be used to find points of interest (POIs), such as cafes. You can create an autocomplete search experience that makes it easier for users to find cafes. The Search Box API can be used to search for a specific cafe or browse entire categories of results, like cafes. More details about this can be found in this [Mapbox blog post](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/introducing-search-box).\n\nSecondly, you would need to add your own data to the map. This can be done by creating a custom map style in Mapbox Studio that includes your data. You can incorporate cafes from a third-party API as a symbol layer, then hide other POIs in your map. More details about this can be found in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64657596).\n\nLastly, you can use Mapbox's filters to only display specific building types, such as cafes. This can be done by using expressions in Mapbox GL JS to customize the store location results based on store type. More details about this can be found in this [Mapbox tutorial](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/tilequery-healthy-food-finder#next-steps).\n\nHere is an example of how you can set up an expression to favor cafes:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"case\",\n  [\n    \"==\",\n    [\"get\", \"maki\"],\n    \"cafe\"\n  ],\n  1,\n  2\n]\n```\n\nThis expression will return 1 for cafes and 2 for all other icons, meaning cafes will be favored when there are collisions.

      "question": "If my worker lives on different microservices due to accessing different database. How to import the activity in the orchestrator to the worker in each microservice?",
      "answer": "In a microservices architecture, each service can start a worker on its own task queue and register the activities that are the responsibility of that service. The workflow, which could be in an integration service or orchestrator, should specify the appropriate task queue when invoking activities on that service. This can be done by setting the task queue name explicitly in the `ActivityOptions`. Here is an example using Java SDK:\n\n```java\nActivityOptions service1Options =\n    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setTaskQueue(\"service1\")\n        .setScheduleToStartTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n        .build();\nService1 service1 =\n    Workflow.newActivityStub(Service1.class, service1Options);\n```\n\nIn this example, `service1` is the task queue for the service that hosts the worker and the activities. The workflow uses this task queue to schedule activities on this service.\n\nFor TypeScript, you can create functions that create Activities. This is a helpful pattern for using closures to share dependencies such as database connections. Here is an example:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface DB {  \n get(key: string): Promise<string>;  \n}  \n  \nexport const createActivities = (db: DB) => ({  \n async greet(msg: string): Promise<string> {  \n const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db  \n return `${msg}: ${name}`;  \n },  \n async greet_es(mensaje: string): Promise<string> {  \n const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db  \n return `${mensaje}: ${name}`;  \n },  \n});  \n```\n\nWhen you register these in the Worker, pass your shared dependencies accordingly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createActivities } from './activities';  \n  \nasync function run() {  \n // Mock DB connection initialization in Worker  \n const db = {  \n async get(_key: string) {  \n return 'Temporal';  \n },  \n };  \n  \n const worker = await Worker.create({  \n taskQueue: 'dependency-injection',  \n workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),  \n activities: createActivities(db),  \n });  \n  \n await worker.run();  \n}  \n  \nrun().catch((err) => {  \n console.error(err);  \n process.exit(1);  \n});\n```\n\nIn this example, `createActivities(db)` creates the activities with the shared database connection `db`. The activities are then registered with the worker.\n\nSources:\n- [Distributed Activity Execution in multiple Microservices](https://community.temporal.io/t/7248)\n- [Share dependencies in Activity functions (dependency injection)](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#share-dependencies-in-activity-functions-dependency-injection)"

      "answer": "To enable Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) or two-factor authentication (2FA) on FusionAuth, you can use the Two Factor API or enable it in the admin UI. \n\nHere are the steps to enable it in the admin UI:\n\n1. If you want to turn it on for yourself, go to your user details screen and then click 'Enable Two Factor' from the dropdown in the upper right hand corner.\n2. If you want to turn it on for other users, go to their user details screen and then click 'Edit Profile' from the dropdown in the upper right hand corner. From there you should be able to enable Two Factor authentication.\n\nIf you want to use a MFA app on your phone that uses TOTP like Google Authenticator, you do not have to enable the Twilio integration. \n\nPlease note that while there is underlying support for different code lengths, algorithms and time steps, at the current time the system only allows for the following TOTP settings:\n\n- `authenticator.algorithm`: `HmacSHA1`\n- `authenticator.codeLength`: `6`\n- `authenticator.timeStep`: `30`\n\nAny attempt to change these configuration values will currently be ignored. If you need different configuration settings, you can file a GitHub issue detailing your use case.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to these sources: [Forum Question](https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/56/how-can-i-turn-on-two-factor-authentication), [Docs - TOTP Implementation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/two-factor#totp-implementation), [Docs - Core Concepts](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/limitations#totp-algorithm-implementation)."

      "answer": "Based on the information from the knowledge sources, GrowthBook doesn't require you to create specific tables or columns. It is designed to work with your existing data structure. However, for A/B testing, you would need a table that tracks exposures, which should include a user id (or your randomization unit), the experiment name, variation id, and a timestamp of when the exposure occurred.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure such a table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE exposures (\n    user_id INT,\n    experiment_name VARCHAR(255),\n    variation_id INT,\n    exposure_time TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example. You might need to adjust the data types or add additional columns based on your specific needs.\n\nWhen querying the data in GrowthBook, you can use SQL aliases if your column names are different from what GrowthBook expects. For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  my_user_id_column as user_id,\n  my_experiment_name_column as experiment_name,\n  my_variation_id_column as variation_id,\n  my_timestamp_column as timestamp\nFROM\n  my_table\n```\n\nRemember to replace `my_user_id_column`, `my_experiment_name_column`, `my_variation_id_column`, `my_timestamp_column`, and `my_table` with your actual column and table names.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [GrowthBook documentation on data sources](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/datasources#configuration-settings).\n\nPlease note that this is a basic guide and your actual implementation may vary based on your specific use case and data structure.

      "answer": "Yes, you can manually transfer content from one version of a theme to another. Here are the steps to do so:\n\n1. Open the theme editor for both versions of the theme in separate windows. You can do this by right-clicking the **Customize** link next to each theme, then selecting **Open in new tab**.\n\n2. By placing them side-by-side in separate windows, you can go section by section and match the settings, copy, and content. For instance, to match **Colors** settings, click on the swatch. In the bottom right of the popup modal, you'll see a six-value code. Copy this code and paste it into the matching color field in the new version.\n\n3. Next, you'll need to migrate any custom code added to your Liquid files. If the custom code is not documented, you can use the file comparison tool [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to help you remember where you've added custom code.\n\n4. Once you've migrated all your settings and custom code, you can publish the new version of the theme.\n\nRemember to add comments to any custom code carried over or future additions made. This will allow you to search and locate any custom code quickly when making future updates. Comments will not affect the code. Simply add `<!--` and `-->` on either side of your comment, like so:\n```\n<!-- This is a comment. Custom code.-->\n```\n\nPlease note that if you are using a vintage theme (a theme version released before the new theme architecture was implemented), the Theme Updater Plus's Pro plan features are limited to minimal content migration. In this case, content added through the theme editor (to sections, templates, etc.) cannot transfer to the new theme architecture.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, please refer to the [source](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409266932883-Updating-a-theme-manually#transfer)."

Since Ory Hydra 0.8.0, migrations are no longer run automatically on boot. This is required in production environments for two reasons:\n\n1. Although SQL migrations are tested, migrating schemas can cause data loss and should only be done consciously with prior back-ups.\n2. Running a production system with a user that has rights such as ALTER TABLE is a security anti-pattern.\n\nTo initialize the database schemas, you need to run `hydra migrate sql driver://user:password@host:port/db` before running `hydra host`. This command creates SQL schemas and applies migration plans. It should be run on a fresh SQL installation and when you upgrade Hydra to a new minor version. \n\nBefore running this command on an existing database, it's crucial to create a backup. The command also runs database migrations in case of an upgrade. Always create a backup before running `hydra migrate sql`!\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Ory Hydra documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/faq#how-should-i-run-migrations)."

      "answer": "If your `observation_space` is an `OrderedDict` that contains an `action_mask`, you can modify your preprocessor initialization as follows:\n\nFirst, you need to ensure that your `observation_space` is defined correctly in your environment. Here is an example of how you can define it:\n\n```python\nfrom gym.spaces import Box, Dict, Discrete\n\nclass MyEnv(gym.Env):\n    def __init__(self, max_avail_actions):\n        self.action_space = Discrete(max_avail_actions)\n        self.observation_space = Dict({\n            \"action_mask\": Box(0, 1, shape=(max_avail_actions, )),\n            \"observations\": ...,\n        })\n```\nIn this example, `action_mask` is a part of the `observation_space` and it is a binary mask indicating the valid actions at each step.\n\nThen, you can get the preprocessor for your environment's `observation_space` like this:\n\n```python\nprep = get_preprocessor(env.observation_space)(env.observation_space)\n```\n\nThis line of code is creating an instance of the appropriate preprocessor for your environment's `observation_space`. The `get_preprocessor` function determines the correct preprocessor class based on the `observation_space`, and then the `observation_space` is passed to the preprocessor's constructor to create an instance.\n\nIf you encounter issues with the data type of your `action_mask`, you might need to ensure that the data type of your `action_mask` matches the data type defined in your `observation_space`. For example, if your `observation_space` defines `action_mask` as `np.float`, you should ensure that your `action_mask` is also of type `np.float` [source](https://discuss.ray.io/t/6355).\n\nIf you're still having trouble, it might be helpful to use a custom model with Ray's `randomenv` to determine if there are issues with your custom model [source](https://discuss.ray.io/t/9160)."

The boxes will not be modifiable but can still be queried using the SDKs. The minimum balance will also be locked.

Each box increases the minimum balance requirement of the application account. If the smart contract is deleted, the minimum balance is forever lost. This is true even if the application account is rekeyed to another account.

      "answer": "Based on the information from the knowledge sources, it seems that you can create a dropdown menu of options in Toddle by using a combination of components, attributes, and variables. \n\nHere's a general approach based on the discussions:\n\n1. Create a component for your dropdown menu. This component can have attributes that determine its appearance, size, etc.\n\n2. Use a `select` element within your component to create the dropdown menu. \n\n3. Use a repeater to populate the `select` element with options based on results from an API or a predefined list.\n\n4. To use the selected value for future tasks, you might need to find the index value of the selected item and return the corresponding key or value.\n\nHowever, the exact attribute to set for an input field to create a dropdown menu of options is not explicitly mentioned in the provided knowledge sources. The process might vary depending on the specific requirements of your application.\n\nFor a more detailed guide, you might find these resources helpful:\n\n- [Button components with a utility-first approach](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1178723984888569897)\n- [Best approach for dropdowns](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1131999380854034562)\n- [Form Dropdown - options from API response](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1163294456775184485)\n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines and the exact implementation might vary.

Here is an example using the Python SDK:\n\n```python\nfrom algosdk import mnemonic, account\n\n# replace 'your 25-word mnemonic' with your actual mnemonic\nmn = 'your 25-word mnemonic'\nprivate_key = mnemonic.to_private_key(mn)\npublic_key = account.address_from_private_key(private_key)\n\nprint(f\"Address: {public_key}\")\nprint(f\"Private Key: {private_key}\")\nprint(f\"Mnemonic: {mn}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `mnemonic.to_private_key(mn)` function is used to convert the 25-word mnemonic to a private key. The `account.address_from_private_key(private_key)` function is then used to get the public key (address) from the private key.\n\nPlease remember to replace `'your 25-word mnemonic'` with your actual 25-word mnemonic.\n\nRemember, never share your mnemonic and private key.

Here's a breakdown of how rewards work in different scenarios:\n\n1. **Machine Owners**: Machine owners who connect their devices to the peaq network are rewarded. This is amplified by peaq's own rewards system, adding more rewards to DePIN rewards. The network also channels rewards to DePINs, supporting them with a sustainable revenue stream [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/peaq-a-layer-1-blockchain-designed-for-depins-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks).\n\n2. **Raspberry Pi Connection**: Device owners who connect their Raspberry Pi to the network can earn rewards. The longer the Raspberry Pi stays connected, the more the owner earns. Rewards for each connected Raspberry Pi are based on how long it had been connected to the network [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/connect-your-raspberry-pi-and-earn).\n\n3. **peaq Ambassadors**: Ambassadors are rewarded with NFTs, access to Ambassador-only forums and events, peaq-branded goodies, and tokens. Successful introductions to DePINs can earn up to $2500 in stablecoins, and there will be opportunities to earn $PEAQ and $KREST tokens too [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/how-to-become-a-peaq-ambassador).\n\n4. **DePIN Participants**: DePIN participants are rewarded with tokens for specific useful activities, such as selling energy via their solar panels or renting out their routers. DePIN tokens work as an incentive mechanism meant to encourage the supply side to build up the network’s capabilities [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin).\n\n5. **General Network Participants**: peaq incentivizes node hosts, machines, DePINs, dApps, Liquidity Providers, and communities connecting their devices to the network. The rewards for all of these network participants will come primarily from transaction fees and block rewards [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/peaq-a-layer-1-blockchain-designed-for-depins-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks).\n\n6. **Transaction Fees and Inflation**: The transaction fees on peaq include a basic fee and an optional fee to get the transaction validated faster. The inflation begins at 2.5% and decreases every year by 10% until it reaches 1%, which will become the fixed long-term rate. This disinflationary approach rewards early backers [source](https://www.peaq.network/blog/introducing-peaqs-economics-low-inflation-low-transaction-fees-innovative-rewards).\n\nIn summary, the peaq network has a comprehensive reward system designed to incentivize various stakeholders who contribute to the growth and operation of the network."

      "answer": "In Astro, you can use JavaScript DOM manipulation in a similar way to how you would in a traditional HTML file.

When this button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called. This function changes the innerHTML of the element with the id \"demo\" to \"help me!\".\n\nHowever, it's important to note that you can't assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component directly. For example, the following code won't work:\n\n```html\n<button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button>\n```\n\nInstead, you should use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Astro documentation on client-side scripts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/)."

      "question": "assume i have a temporal workflow in python with two activities, it starts to run then the cancellation request comes. is it possible that cancellation request came when first activity is finished and second activity is not started?",
      "answer": "Yes, it is possible for a cancellation request to come in between the execution of two activities in a Temporal workflow. When a cancellation request is made, it raises errors in the underlying code, but these can be caught and ignored. If a workflow is cancelled from a client, Temporal will relay that to the workflow as a task cancellation, which causes an `asyncio.CancelledError` to be raised. \n\nIn Python, you can use `asyncio.shield` to ensure that an important activity cannot be cancelled. However, this will not stop the outer part from still raising a cancelled error which, if uncaught, will cancel the workflow thereby cancelling the activity anyways.\n\nHere is an example of how you can structure your workflow to handle cancellation:\n\n```python\n@workflow.defn\nclass MyWorkflow:\n def __init__(self):\n self.stage = 0\n\n @workflow.run\n async def run(self) -> None:\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 1\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_1, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=45))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 1\")\n await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 0)\n\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 2\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_2, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 2\")\n await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 1)\n```\n\nIn this example, if a cancellation request is received after `my_activity_1` has finished but before `my_activity_2` has started, the workflow will be cancelled and `my_activity_2` will not start.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Temporal documentation on cancellation](https://docs.temporal.io/activities#cancellation) and the [Temporal Python SDK](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html).\n\nSources:\n- [Temporal Workflows are Asyncio Event Loops](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop)\n- [The Answer Part 1](https://temporal.io/blog/community-threads-is-it-possible-to-create-an-event-based-workflow)\n- [What is a Temporal Activity?](https://docs.temporal.io/activities#cancellation)\n- [Python SDK](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html)"

The title in tabs is currently \"{resource label} | refine\". I'd like it to be \"{resource label} | {app name}\". \n\nWhere can I set the app name?",
      "answer": "You can configure the page title/name on browser tabs in Refine by using the `DocumentTitleHandler` component provided by the router integration packages. This component allows you to manage document titles depending on the resource and actions of the current route.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it in your `App.tsx` file:\n\n```jsx\nimport routerBindings, {  \n DocumentTitleHandler,  \n} from \"@refinedev/react-router-v6\";  \nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from \"react-router-dom\";  \n\nfunction App() {  \n return (  \n <BrowserRouter>  \n <Refine  \n routerProvider={routerBindings}  \n >  \n <Routes>  \n <Route index element={<WelcomePage />} />  \n </Routes>  \n <DocumentTitleHandler />  \n </Refine>  \n </BrowserRouter>  \n );  \n}  \n```\n\nIn this example, `DocumentTitleHandler` is imported from `@refinedev/react-router-v6` and used inside the `Refine` component. This will automatically manage the document title based on the current route.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/routers/react-router-v6/#documenttitlehandler).\n\nPlease note that the `DocumentTitleHandler` component is also available in the `@refinedev/nextjs-router` package if you are using Next.js. However, it is not available in the `@refinedev/remix-router` package due to Remix handling titles differently.\n\nIf you want to customize the title further, you might need to create a custom hook or component that listens to route changes and updates the document title accordingly. This would involve using the `useDocumentTitle` hook and the `onDocumentTitle` callback in the `Refine` component, as discussed in this [Github issue](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/2810). However, this is a more advanced topic and might require a deeper understanding of React and Refine."

      "question": "Interested in using spot instance for scaling in and scaling out for index node",
      "answer": "Milvus supports horizontal scaling, which includes scaling out (increasing the number of nodes in a cluster) and scaling in (decreasing the number of nodes in a cluster). This applies to various types of nodes, including index nodes. \n\nTo manually scale out the index node, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade my-release milvus/milvus --set indexNode.replicas=3 --reuse-values\n```\n\nThis command increases the number of index nodes to 3. If successful, three running pods on the index node are added.\n\nTo scale in the index node, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade my-release milvus/milvus --set indexNode.replicas=1 --reuse-values\n```\n\nThis command reduces the number of index nodes to 1. If successful, the running pods on the index node are reduced to one.\n\nAs for using spot instances, while the provided knowledge sources do not specifically mention spot instances, it's important to note that the use of spot instances would depend on the cloud provider and the configuration of your Kubernetes cluster. Spot instances can indeed provide cost savings and can be used for workloads that are interruptible. However, they may not be suitable for all types of workloads due to their ephemeral nature.\n\nPlease refer to the [Milvus Scale Guide](https://milvus.io/docs/scaleout.md) for more detailed instructions on scaling in and out.\n\nPlease note that as of Milvus 2.1.0, only manual scaling in and out is supported. Automatic scaling based on resource consumption is not yet available."

      "question": "which slos in temporal system",
      "answer": "Temporal provides several Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to ensure optimal performance and reliability of its system. Here are some of the key SLOs:\n\n1. **Latency SLO**: Temporal Cloud aims for a latency SLO of 200ms per region for p99. This is based on measurements of latency over a week-long period for starting and signaling Workflow Executions. For example, in June 2023, the p90 latency for `StartWorkflowExecution` was 90ms, and p99 latency was 125ms. These numbers are expected to decrease as Temporal continues to improve latencies. However, the observed latency from the Temporal Client can be influenced by other system components like the Codec Server, egress proxy, and the network itself. Increased latency might result from concurrent operations on the same Workflow Execution [[source](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/service-availability#latency)].\n\n2. **Service Error Rate SLO**: Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability, and its service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors. The service-error rate is calculated as `1 - (count of errors / count of requests)`, with rates averaged per month and reset quarterly. However, not all errors are counted against the SLA. For example, errors like `ClientVersionNotSupported`, `InvalidArgument`, `NamespaceAlreadyExists`, etc., are not counted against the SLA [[source](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)].\n\n3. **StartWorkflowExecution Latency SLO**: When scaling Temporal, one of the SLOs is to expect a `StartWorkflowExecution` request latency of less than 150ms. If a load test can run within this latency SLO, it is considered that the cluster can handle the load [[source](https://temporal.io/blog/scaling-temporal-the-basics)].\n\n4. **Support Response Time SLO**: Temporal offers two levels of support with different response time SLOs. For Basic Support, the response times are P0: 1 hour, P1: 4 business hours, P2: 1 business day, P3: 2 business days. For Premium Support, the response times are P0: 30 minutes, P1: 1 business hour, P2: 4 business hours, P3: 1 business day [[source](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support)].\n\nPlease note that these SLOs are subject to change and it's always a good idea to check the latest documentation or contact Temporal for the most up-to-date information."

      "answer": "Yes, you can limit the number of product categories returned in the list by using the `limit` property. This is applicable when you are using the `useAdminProductCategories` or `useProductCategories` hooks from the `medusa-react` library. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `limit` property:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useAdminProductCategories } from \"medusa-react\"  \n  \nfunction Categories() {  \n const {   \n product_categories,  \n limit,  \n offset,  \n isLoading   \n } = useAdminProductCategories({  \n expand: \"category_children\",  \n limit: 20,  \n offset: 0  \n })  \n  \n return (  \n <div>  \n {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}  \n {product_categories && !product_categories.length && (  \n <span>No Categories</span>  \n )}  \n {product_categories && product_categories.length > 0 && (  \n <ul>  \n {product_categories.map(  \n (category) => (  \n <li key={category.id}>{category.name}</li>  \n )  \n )}  \n </ul>  \n )}  \n </div>  \n )  \n}  \n  \nexport default Categories  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `limit` property is set to `20`, which means only the first 20 product categories will be retrieved. You can adjust this number according to your needs.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/medusa-react/hooks/admin/product_categories#example-5)."

The primary objective is to facilitate efficient resource isolation, maintain data integrity, and manage access for different clients. \n\nBy default, a database named 'memgraph' is automatically created during startup. New users are granted access only to this default database. The default database name cannot be altered. \n\nIsolated databases within Memgraph function as distinct single-database Memgraph instances. Queries executed on a specific database should operate as if it were the sole database in the system, preventing cross-database contamination. Users interact with individual databases, and cross-database queries are prohibited.\n\nAt present, all isolated databases share identical configurations. There is no provision to specify a per-database configuration. The sole distinction lies in the location of the data directory. The designated data directory serves as the root and retains data associated with the default database. Other databases are housed in new directories within `data_directory/databases/*db_name*` [source](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/multi-tenancy).\n\nPlease note that multi-tenancy is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Memgraph [source](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/enabling-memgraph-enterprise). If you're interested in Memgraph Enterprise, you need to fill out the following [form](https://memgraph.com/enterprise-trial) where one of the fields is the organization name. After getting your license key, set the `organization.name` to the same organization name you used for the license key, and the `enterprise.license` to the license key you received.\n\nIf you're experimenting with Memgraph and need more detailed guidance, it might be helpful to talk to the Memgraph team. They can provide more personalized support and help you make the most of Memgraph's features.

It describes the operation mode of SkyWalking’s back-end analysis platform OAP, and the types and parameters of analysis metrics. The metrics data generated by OAL is the data source for subsequent data export and alarms.\n\nOAL is a scalable and lightweight compiled language that can be customized by users to describe the analysis process. OAL uses SkyWalking's built-in compiler to compile Java class files in runtime (starting from SkyWalking version 6.3), and uses SkyWalking’s stream computing engine to load and run.\n\nOAL scripts are found in the `/config` folder, and users could simply change and reboot the server to run them. However, the OAL script is a compiled language, and the OAL Runtime generates java codes dynamically. Don’t expect to mount the changes of those scripts in the runtime.\n\nThe OAL script should be named `*.oal` and the grammar is as follows:\n```\n// Declare the metrics.\nMETRICS_NAME = from(CAST SCOPE.(* | [FIELD][,FIELD ...]))\n[.filter(CAST FIELD OP [INT | STRING])]\n.FUNCTION([PARAM][, PARAM ...])\n\n// Disable hard code \ndisable(METRICS_NAME);\n```\nThe **from** statement defines the data source of this OAL expression. Primary **SCOPE**s are `Service`, `ServiceInstance`, `Endpoint`, `ServiceRelation`, `ServiceInstanceRelation`, and `EndpointRelation`. There are also some secondary scopes which belong to a primary scope.\n\nThe filter is used to build conditions for the value of fields by using field name and expression. The filter expressions run as a chain, generally connected with `logic AND`. The OPs support `==`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=`, `in [...]` ,`like %...`, `like ...%` , `like %...%` , `contain` and `not contain`, with type detection based on field type. In the event of incompatibility, compile or code generation errors may be triggered.\n\nSources:\n- [Apache SkyWalking in Action](https://tetrate.io/resource/apache-skywalking-in-action/)\n- [SkyWalking Documentation](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/latest/en/concepts-and-designs/oal#observability-analysis-language)"

      "question": "how to set a temporal schedule to run every day at a certain time using golang",
      "answer": "I'm sorry, but the provided knowledge sources do not contain specific information on how to set a Temporal schedule to run every day at a certain time using Golang. However, they do provide some information on how to create a schedule in general using the Go SDK for Temporal. \n\nHere is an example of how to create a schedule:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {  \n// ...  \n scheduleID := \"schedule_id\"  \n workflowID := \"schedule_workflow_id\"  \n // Create the schedule.  \n scheduleHandle, err := temporalClient.ScheduleClient().Create(ctx, client.ScheduleOptions{  \n ID: scheduleID,  \n Spec: client.ScheduleSpec{},  \n Action: &client.ScheduleWorkflowAction{  \n ID: workflowID,  \n Workflow: schedule.ScheduleWorkflow,  \n TaskQueue: \"schedule\",  \n },  \n })  \n// ...  \n}  \n// ...  \n```\nIn this example, a unique Schedule ID is generated for each new Schedule. The `Create()` function is used on the Temporal Client to create a Schedule. The Schedule must be initialized with a Schedule ID, Spec, and Action in `client.ScheduleOptions{}`.\n\nFor more specific details on how to set a schedule to run every day at a certain time, you may need to refer to the Temporal documentation or community for more information.\n\n[Source](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/go/features#schedule-a-workflow)"

      "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble setting a radio button on the 'Fixed Asset Listing' page in Dynamics 365 F&O using the text method. Let's try to troubleshoot this issue.\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. **Complex HTML Structures**: Microsoft's updates to Dynamics 365 have changed dropdown HTML structures, making them non-traditional and complex for Leapwork to interact with. This could also be the case with radio buttons.\n\n2. **Incorrect Locator**: The locator for the radio button might not be correctly set.\n\n3. **XHR Requests or DOM Changes**: If there are active XHR requests or DOM changes, Leapwork might delay the search for the web element.\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Locator\n\nEnsure that the locator for the radio button is correctly set. You can capture a new web element locator by right-clicking on the property and selecting “Capture new web element”. Once set, the web element locator can be edited by right-clicking and selecting “Edit web element”.\n\n### Step 2: Check for XHR Requests or DOM Changes\n\nIf there are active XHR requests or DOM changes, Leapwork might delay the search for the web element. You can set the 'Await Requests' and 'Await Timeout' properties to handle this.\n\n### Step 3: Try Different Methods\n\nIf the text method is not working, try setting the radio button using value or index.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Updates\n\nEnsure that you are using the latest version of Leapwork. We have made improvements to handle the new structures in Dynamics 365 F&O.\n\nIf you're still having trouble after trying these steps, could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically, any error messages you're seeing and the exact steps you're taking would be helpful.\n\n## Knowledge Sources Used\n\n1.

      "answer": "The Hydra OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server from Ory provides a mechanism that allows updating `id_token` and `access_token` when a registered client sends a token request. This flow is realized by calling the defined token hook endpoint which returns updated data. If the data provided by the webhook is different from the data the client sends, the webhook overwrites the session data with a new set.\n\nTo enable this feature, you can use the Ory CLI with the following keys:\n\n```bash\nory patch oauth2-config {project.id} \\  \n --add '/oauth2/token_hook=\"https://my-example.app/token-hook\"' \\  \n --format yaml  \n```\n\nThe token hook endpoint must accept the following payload format:\n\n```json\n{  \n \"session\": {  \n \"id_token\": {  \n \"id_token_claims\": {  \n \"jti\": \"\",  \n \"iss\": \"http://localhost:4444/\",  \n \"sub\": \"subject\",  \n \"aud\": [\"app-client\"],  \n \"nonce\": \"\",  \n \"at_hash\": \"\",  \n \"acr\": \"1\",  \n \"amr\": null,  \n \"c_hash\": \"\",  \n \"ext\": {}  \n },  \n \"headers\": {  \n \"extra\": {}  \n },  \n \"username\": \"\",  \n \"subject\": \"foo\"  \n },  \n \"extra\": {},  \n \"client_id\": \"app-client\",  \n \"consent_challenge\": \"\",  \n \"exclude_not_before_claim\": false,  \n \"allowed_top_level_claims\": []  \n },  \n \"request\": {  \n \"client_id\": \"app-client\",  \n \"granted_scopes\": [\"offline\", \"openid\", \"hydra.*\"],  \n \"granted_audience\": [],  \n \"grant_types\": [\"authorization_code\"],  \n \"payload\": {}  \n }  \n}  \n```\n\nPlease note that the hook is called before any other logic is executed. If the hook execution fails, the entire token flow fails. You can use this hooks feature with all grant types.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Ory documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/guides/claims-at-refresh)."

However, there have been some changes and issues reported with its usage. \n\nIn Next.js 13, the `as` prop was used to specify the URL that should be shown in the browser.

However, you can manually update your dashboards by downloading the latest JSON model from the dashboard's page and importing it into your Grafana instance.\n\nAs for notifications, Grafana 8.5 introduced a new feature that allows you to check for Grafana version updates and updates to versions of Grafana plugins separately. This is done using a new configuration option that enables plugin version update checks separately. When enabled, the updated configuration will run a check every 10 minutes and notify you via the UI when a new version is available. However, this feature does not prompt any auto-updates of the Grafana software or plugins, nor does it send any sensitive information. It's also important to note that this feature is for Grafana and plugin updates, not dashboard updates.\n\nFor best practices in managing dashboards, Grafana recommends having a strategic observability plan, adapting your strategy to changing needs as necessary, and understanding your dashboard maturity level. You can analyze your current dashboard setup and compare it to the Dashboard management maturity model to help you decide how to improve your dashboards.\n\nSources:\n- [Grafana 8.5: updated panels, new RBAC features, simplified reporting, and more!](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/04/21/new-in-grafana-8.5-updated-panels-new-rbac-features-simplified-reporting-and-more#better-software-update-notifications)\n- [Best practices for managing dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/best-practices#best-practices-for-managing-dashboards)"

You can obtain the latest theme version with the Free plan features of the Theme Updater or through the Shopify Theme Store. Both options are free. However, Flex, Turbo, and Superstore are limited to the Theme Updater option. You can follow the steps outlined [here](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409266932883-Updating-a-theme-manually) for manual updates.\n\n2. **Theme Updater Plus Pro Plan Updates**: To update your theme using Theme Updater, your theme must be supported and registered. You can follow the steps outlined [here](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007099548-Update-your-theme-with-Theme-Updater-Pro-Plan) for Theme Updater Plus Pro Plan updates.\n\n3. **3rd-party service updates**: If you require further assistance upgrading your theme, you can reach out to one of the Shopify experts listed [here](https://outofthesandbox.com/pages/services).\n\nPlease note that any apps that add code to your theme's files may need to be reinstalled, depending on the app developer. You'll need to find the app documentation to follow the installation instructions. For guidance, go to Apps then click View details to find the support email for that Shopify app. \n\nAlso, if you have customizations, you will need to apply (reproduce) all your custom edits in the new theme manually. This only applies if you are using the alternative method - your theme settings and basic customizations will be carried over if you use the Theme Updater app. \n\nIf you are using a vintage theme, it is advised to start fresh with an Online Store 2.0-compatible version for the best results. You can manually update to Turbo v7+, Retina v6+, Flex v3+, Responsive v8+, Parallax v5+, or Superstore v4+ to harness the full suite of Theme Updater Plus's Pro plan features. After this is complete, your theme will be fully compatible with Theme Updater Plus's full suite of Updater Pro Plan features."

During the upgrade process, these new features are kept disabled to prevent sending the new data formats to processes that are still running the old version. After all YugabyteDB processes have been upgraded to the new version, these features can be enabled by promoting their AutoFlags.\n\nYou can use the `yb-admin` utility to promote the new AutoFlags. Here is the syntax:\n\n```bash\nyb-admin \\\n -master_addresses <master-addresses> \\\n promote_auto_flags \\\n [<max_flags_class> [<promote_non_runtime_flags> [force]]]\n```\n\nIn this command:\n- `master-addresses` is a comma-separated list of YB-Master hosts and ports. The default value is `localhost:7100`.\n- `max_flags_class` is the maximum AutoFlag class to promote. Allowed values are `kLocalVolatile`, `kLocalPersisted`, `kExternal`, `kNewInstallsOnly`. The default value is `kExternal`.\n- `promote_non_runtime_flags` determines whether to promote non-runtime flags. Allowed values are `true` and `false`. The default value is `true`.\n- `force` forces the generation of a new AutoFlag configuration and sends it to all YugabyteDB processes even if there are no new AutoFlags to promote.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n./bin/yb-admin \\\n -master_addresses ip1:7100,ip2:7100,ip3:7100 \\\n promote_auto_flags kLocalPersisted\n```\n\nIf the operation is successful, you should see output similar to the following:\n\n```\nPromoteAutoFlags status:\nNew AutoFlags were promoted. Config version: 2\n```\n\nOr\n\n```\nPromoteAutoFlags status:\nNo new AutoFlags to promote\n```\n\nPlease note that `promote_auto_flags` is idempotent and can be run multiple times. Before promoting AutoFlags, ensure that all YugabyteDB processes in the cluster have been upgraded to the new version. Process running an old version may fail to connect to the cluster after the AutoFlags have been promoted.\n\nAfter promoting the AutoFlags, wait at least 10 seconds (`FLAGS_auto_flags_apply_delay_ms`) for the new AutoFlags to be propagated and applied on all YugabyteDB processes.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [YugabyteDB documentation](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/admin/yb-admin#promote-auto-flags)."

Some users have reported that certain features they rely on, such as Bluetooth services and system-specific drivers, were disabled after installing AtlasOS [source](https://forum.atlasos.net/d/355-okay-first-off-what-the-heck).\n\nIn terms of security, Atlas aims to be as secure as you want it to be, with the ability to toggle Windows Defender, various mitigations, and Windows Update. However, it's important to note that fundamentally, unmodified Windows from Microsoft is always going to be the most trusted and secure version of Windows available [source](https://docs.atlasos.net/faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/atlas-and-security#how-secure-is-atlas).\n\nIn conclusion, whether AtlasOS is worth it or not can depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize gaming performance and don't mind potentially losing some features, AtlasOS could be a good choice for you. However, if you rely on certain features that AtlasOS disables, or if you prioritize having the most secure version of Windows available, AtlasOS may not be the best choice for you."

In some cases, you can perform a \"Fast Unstake\" to circumvent the unbonding period if your account was not exposed to any active validator for the last unbonding period (28 eras) [source](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169433).\n\nFor more specific information about re-delegating your staking balance, I would recommend checking the official Polkadot documentation or reaching out to their support."

      "question": "how to authenticate with temporal ",
      "answer": "Temporal provides several methods for authentication to ensure the security of your data. These methods can be used to authenticate servers, clients, and users.\n\nFor Temporal Cloud:\n\n1. You can use Google and Microsoft authentication, or configure SSO providers based on SAML 2.0. To authenticate the users of your Temporal Cloud account, you can connect an identity provider (IdP) to your account by using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b31gqZCLFTA)\n\n2. You can also use CA certificates to authenticate client connections to your Temporal Cluster. On Temporal Cloud, you can set your CA certificates in your Temporal Cloud settings and use the end-entity certificates in your client calls. [Source](https://docs.temporal.io/clusters#using-certificates-for-client-connections)\n\n3. You can use the tcld to authenticate, generate, and add certificates to your Cloud account. Here is an example of how to do it:\n```bash\n# Login\ntcld login  \n\n# Create certs\ntcld generate-certificates certificate-authority-certificate --org ${ACCOUNT_ID} -d 1y --ca-cert ca.pem --ca-key ca.key  \n\n# Add certificates to Cloud account\ntcld namespace accepted-client-ca add --ca-certificate-file ca.pem  \n```\nReplace `${ACCOUNT_ID}` with your Temporal Cloud account ID. [Source](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/metrics/datadog#step-2-create-your-certificates)\n\nFor Self-hosted Temporal:\n\n1. Temporal provides authentication interfaces that can be set to restrict access to your data. Temporal offers two plugin interfaces for authentication and authorization of API calls: `ClaimMapper` and `Authorizer`. The logic of both plugins can be customized to fit a variety of use cases. [Source](https://docs.temporal.io/clusters#authentication-and-authorization)\n\n2. On self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can restrict access to Temporal Cluster endpoints by using the `clientCAFiles` or `clientCAData` property and the `requireClientAuth` property in your Cluster configuration. [Source](https://docs.temporal.io/clusters#using-certificates-for-client-connections)\n\n3. Temporal can be integrated with a single sign-on (SSO) experience by utilizing the `ClaimMapper` and `Authorizer` plugins. [Source](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/security#single-sign-on-integration)\n\nFor more detailed instructions, please refer to the Temporal documentation."

      "answer": "To add a font in Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the font from `next/font/google` or `next/font/local` in your layout file. For example, if you want to use the `Inter` font from Google Fonts, you can import it like this:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n```\n\n2. Load your font with the `variable` option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to a variable. Then, use this variable to add the CSS variable to your HTML document:\n\n```tsx\nconst inter = Inter({\n subsets: ['latin'],\n display: 'swap',\n variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n```\n\n3. In your layout component, add the CSS variable to the `className` of your HTML element:\n\n```tsx\nexport default function RootLayout({\n children,\n}: {\n children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n return (\n <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n <body>{children}</body>\n </html>\n )\n}\n```\n\n4. Finally, add the CSS variable to your Tailwind CSS config:\n\n```js\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n content: [\n './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n ],\n theme: {\n extend: {\n fontFamily: {\n sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n },\n },\n },\n plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\n5. You can now use the `font-sans` and `font-mono` utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#with-tailwind-css)."

      "question": "restart running workflow as new",
      "answer": "In Temporal, you can restart a running workflow as a new instance using the \"Continue-As-New\" feature. This feature allows a workflow to close successfully and create a new workflow execution in a single atomic operation. The new workflow execution has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History. It is passed all the appropriate parameters.\n\nHere's how you can use \"Continue-As-New\" in Java:\n\n```java\nWorkflow.continueAsNew(input1, ...);  \n```\n\nIf you want to continue execution of a currently running Workflow as a completely different Workflow Type, you can use `Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub()`. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nMyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class);  \ncontinueAsNew.greet(input);  \n```\n\nYou can also provide `ContinueAsNewOptions` options in `Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub()`:\n\n```java\nContinueAsNewOptions options = ContinueAsNewOptions.newBuilder()  \n .setTaskQueue(\"newTaskQueueName\")  \n .build();  \n  \nMyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class, options);  \ncontinueAsNew.greet(input);  \n```\n\nIn TypeScript, you can use the `continueAsNew` function:\n\n```typescript\nimport { continueAsNew, log, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';  \n  \nexport async function loopingWorkflow(iteration = 0): Promise<void> {  \n if (iteration === 10) {  \n return;  \n }  \n log.info('Running Workflow iteration', { iteration });  \n await sleep(1000);  \n await continueAsNew<typeof loopingWorkflow>(iteration + 1);  \n}  \n```\n\nPlease note that some of the Temporal SDK’s APIs for Continue-As-New are defined or implemented as some kind of “error” (for example, in Go, you would create a `NewContinueAsNewError`). Despite being named as such, it’s not really an “error,” in the commonly understood sense. Rather, it’s an artifact of how these SDKs handle a Workflow Execution’s completion for Continue-As-New versus successful completion.\n\nSources:\n- [Temporal Workflows as Actors](https://temporal.io/blog/workflows-as-actors-is-it-really-possible)\n- [Continue-As-New on demand](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#continue-as-new-on-demand)\n- [Very Long Running Workflows](https://temporal.io/blog/very-long-running-workflows)\n- [How to Continue-As-New in Java](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/java/features#continue-as-new)\n- [How to Continue-As-New in TypeScript](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/features#continue-as-new)\n- [Java SDK Documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.22.3/index-all.html)"

Assuming your sessions would begin and end with the events you're interested in, measuring a user session overall should be able to get you the same results. If you don’t have a Session ID instrumented, you also have the option of setting a custom Session definition per Project.\n\n2. **Funnel Chart**: If you’d prefer to use specific events to measure the amount of time between the two, you can use the Funnel chart. Specifically, the avg time and time to convert metrics will be handy.\n\n3. **Event Segmentation**: To track duration, you would need to capture the timestamp of a start event and timestamp of an end event, calculate the difference between the two timestamps, and then pass in the duration as an event property for that end event. You can then segment and analyze by property metrics like property sum, property average, or property distribution in Event Segmentation.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to these sources: [Community Question](https://community.amplitude.com/product-experimentation-72/way-to-chart-the-time-between-two-specific-events-per-user-1978), [Community Question](https://community.amplitude.com/data-instrumentation-57/how-can-i-get-below-data-452)."

To change the word to something other than \"Color/Colour\" you can do so in your languages area under Edit theme content > Products > General > Color swatch trigger.\n\nThe theme will then look at the variant names you've used and look for either an HTML color name with the exact same name or a .png image file in Content > Files with a filename-friendly version of your variant name.\n\nFor example, Green swatches would need to be named green.png (capitals become lowercase) and Heather grey swatches would need to be named heather-grey.png (capitals become lowercase, spaces and other special characters become hyphens). Note that .jpg files will not be shown, you must use .png.\n\nIf you change the swatch file, it won't be updated right away due to caching.

      "answer": "In Astro, you can read the body of a request using the `ReadableStream` API. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```ts\nconst reader = await request.body.getReader();\nlet result = await reader.read();\nwhile (!result.done) {\n   // process result.value here\n   result = await reader.read();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `request.body.getReader()` returns a `ReadableStream` reader. You can then use the `read()` method of the reader to read chunks of data from the stream. The `read()` method returns a promise that resolves with an object of the form `{ value, done }`, where `value` is a chunk of data and `done` is a boolean indicating whether the stream is finished.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet is a general example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific use case.\n\nSource: [Github Issue (closed): `ReadableStream` in response body not canceled when client closes connection](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/9068)"

      "question": "why isnt my website publishing",
      "answer": "There could be several reasons why your website isn't publishing on Netlify. Here are a few possible issues and solutions:\n\n1. **Build settings configuration**: Ensure that you've correctly specified the base directory and the publish directory in your build settings. For example, if your project generates the site to publish in a `dist` directory, you should set the \"Publish directory\" to `dist` in your deploy settings. You can find this in your settings at `https://app.netlify.com/sites/{YOUR_SITE}/settings/deploys#continuous-deployment` [[source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/125)].\n\n2. **Case sensitivity issues**: If your site builds locally but fails on deploy, it could be due to case sensitivity issues. Make sure that the case of your filenames and directories matches exactly between your local environment and your GitHub repository [[source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/10754)].\n\n3. **Failed deploy**: If your deploy fails, Netlify provides a \"Why did it fail?\" button that generates a diagnosis and a solution based on the failure. This can help you understand what caused the failure and how to resolve it [[source](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-ai-why-did-my-deploy-fail)].\n\n4. **Git commit issues**: Ensure that your commits are successfully pushed to your repository and that Netlify is retrieving the commit information correctly. If Netlify is missing the commit information, it might not deploy the latest changes to your website [[source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/95714)].\n\n5. **HTTP response issues**: If you're seeing a \"Page not found\" error, it could be due to issues with the HTTP response. To troubleshoot this, you can send the `x-nf-request-id` header from the HTTP response to Netlify support for further investigation [[source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/125)].\n\nIf you're still having issues, you might find it helpful to check out this [Support Guide](https://answers.netlify.com/t/common-issue-frequently-encountered-problems-during-builds/213) which contains many other troubleshooting steps for common concerns."

      "answer": "In Next.js, you can make a page dynamic by using dynamic functions such as `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `searchParams`. These functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params. \n\nHere's how you can use them:\n\n- `cookies()` and `headers()`: Using these in a Server Component will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.\n- `searchParams`: Using the Pages prop will opt the page into dynamic rendering at request time.\n\nUsing any of these functions will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.\n\nHere are the links to the official Next.js documentation for these functions:\n- [`cookies()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)\n- [`headers()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers)\n- [`searchParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there has been a discussion on GitHub about the inability to dynamically set response headers in `page.js` components when using the App router structure. The issue is currently closed, but it's worth keeping an eye on similar discussions for any updates or workarounds.

      "answer": "Yes, you can use Hazelcast with Orbital to integrate your APIs. Orbital is a data gateway that automates the integration, transformation, and discovery of data from data sources across your enterprise, including APIs. It supports external caches and Hazelcast is one of the platforms it supports for caching.\n\nTo enable Hazelcast as a remote cache in Orbital, you need to define a connection to the cache in your `connections.conf` file, then specify the name of the connection in your query. Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```bash\nconnections.conf\n```\n```json\nhazelcast {\n   myHazelcast {\n      connectionName = myHazelcast\n      addresses = [\"localhost:5701\"]\n   }\n}\n```\n```bash\nquery.taxi\n```\n```json\n@Cache(connection = \"myHazelcast\")\nfind { Film[] } as {\n id : FilmId\n // Fetched from a remote service\n currentReviewScore : ReviewScore\n}\n```\nThis configuration will run a near-cache in-process, offloading to the remote Hazelcast cache as the library supports.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Orbital documentation](https://orbitalhq.com/docs/describing-data-sources/caching#using-an-external-cache) and the [Hazelcast documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/integrate/connectors#connectors-for-the-jet-api)."

The documentation provides guides for deploying your Medusa backend on [Heroku](https://docs.medusajs.com/deployments/server/deploying-on-heroku) and [DigitalOcean](https://docs.medusajs.com/deployments/server/deploying-on-digital-ocean). \n\nThe cost will depend on the specific plan you choose with these providers. For example, if you're using the Medusa Admin plugin and want to deploy it with the backend, your chosen plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM. \n\nIt's also worth noting that if you host your backend’s code on GitHub, you can create a GitHub action that builds the admin before the deployment is triggered. This solution decreases the RAM usage, which might help reduce costs.\n\nPlease review the pricing details of each provider to determine the most cost-effective option for your specific needs."

      "answer": "It seems like you're trying to create an update for an item in monday.com using the `create_update` mutation in GraphQL. However, you're encountering a parse error.\n\nThe error message `'Parse error on \"\\\\\\\\\" (error) at [2, 61]'` suggests that there might be an issue with the way you're formatting your GraphQL mutation string. \n\nIn your mutation, you're using template literals to insert variables directly into the mutation string. This can sometimes lead to issues with special characters or escape sequences, which might be causing the parse error.\n\nHere's the mutation you're trying to run:\n\n```javascript\nconst mutation = `mutation {\n    create_update (item_id: ${payload.itemId}, body: \"${JSON.stringify(payload.body)}\") {\n        id\n    }\n}`;\n```\n\nIn this mutation, you're stringifying `payload.body` and inserting it directly into the mutation string. If `payload.body` contains any special characters or escape sequences, this could be causing the parse error.\n\nOne way to avoid this issue is to use variables in your GraphQL mutation. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```javascript\nconst mutation = `mutation ($itemId: ID!, $body: String!) {\n    create_update (item_id: $itemId, body: $body) {\n        id\n    }\n}`;\n\nconst variables = {\n    itemId: payload.itemId,\n    body: JSON.stringify(payload.body)\n};\n\nconst res = await this.monday.api(mutation, variables);\n```\n\nIn this example, `$itemId` and `$body` are variables that you're passing into the mutation. You define these variables in the `variables` object, and then pass this object as the second argument to `this.monday.api()`.\n\nThis approach can help avoid issues with special characters or escape sequences, because you're not inserting the variables directly into the mutation string.\n\nFor more information on how to use the `create_update` mutation, you can refer to the [monday.com API documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/updates).\n\nPlease note that this is a general advice and the exact solution might differ based on the specifics of your implementation and the data you're working with."

      "answer": "`NodeWithScore` is a class in LlamaIndex that is used to wrap a `Node` object along with a `score` value. It is a Pydantic model that captures class names and is used in various processes such as retrieval and postprocessing of nodes. The `NodeWithScore` object has several properties including `node`, `score`, and `class_name`. The `node` is a required field and is of the type `BaseNode`. The `score` is an optional field of type float.\n\nThe score in `NodeWithScore` is not calculated within the class itself. Instead, it is usually assigned when the `NodeWithScore` object is created, based on the results of some other process. For example, in the retrieval process, the score might be the similarity score between the query and the node, calculated by the retrieval model. \n\nHere is an example of how `NodeWithScore` objects are created with scores in a retrieval process:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core.schema import NodeWithScore\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nnodes_with_scores = []\nfor index, node in enumerate(query_result.nodes):\n    score: Optional[float] = None\n    if query_result.similarities is not None:\n        score = query_result.similarities[index]\n    nodes_with_scores.append(NodeWithScore(node=node, score=score))\n```\nIn this example, `query_result.nodes` are the nodes retrieved in response to a query, and `query_result.similarities` are the corresponding similarity scores. For each node, a `NodeWithScore` object is created with the node and its corresponding score.\n\nSources:\n- [NodeWithScore API Documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/api/llama_index.core.schema.NodeWithScore.html)\n- [Example of using NodeWithScore in Retrieval](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/low_level/retrieval.ipynb)\n- [Example of using NodeWithScore in Postprocessing](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/querying/node_postprocessors/root.html)"

      "question": "what’s the simplest way to log strapi 4 output to file",
      "answer": "In Strapi 4, the default log level is set to `silly`, which means that every log is shown, providing the most detailed information. However, in Strapi 5, the log level defaults to `http`, which means that `silly` and `debug` level logs are hidden by default, offering a less verbose log output.\n\nTo adjust the server log level in the configuration to control how much detail you see in your server logs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your server configuration file (`config/server`).\n2. Locate the `{ logger: { config: { level: 'debug' } }` section.\n3. Modify the level value to your preferred log level, such as `silly`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.\n\nThe log level can be configured either in the `server.js` file or as described in the [middlewares configuration](https://docs-next.strapi.io/dev-docs/configurations/middlewares#logger) documentation.\n\nPlease note that this will adjust the verbosity of the logs in your console. If you want to log the output to a file, you would typically do this at the operating system level, by redirecting the output of your Strapi server to a file. This is usually done with command line redirection operators, but the exact method can depend on your operating system and your server setup.\n\nFor example, in a Unix-based system, you might start your server like this:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start > output.log\n```\n\nThis will start your server and redirect all console output to a file named `output.log`. Existing content in `output.log` will be overwritten. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it, you can use `>>` instead of `>`:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start >> output.log\n```\n\nPlease consult your operating system or server documentation for more details on redirecting output to a file.\n\nSource: [Server log level is `http`](https://docs-next.strapi.io/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/server-default-log-level)"

      "answer": "There are three ways to send authenticated requests to the Medusa server: Using a user's API token, using a JWT token, or using a Cookie Session ID.\n\n1. **API Token**: You can use the Update User API Route to add or update the user's API token. Here's how you can do it using Medusa JS Client:\n\n```javascript\nimport Medusa from \"@medusajs/medusa-js\"\nconst medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })\n// must be previously logged in or use api token\nmedusa.admin.users.update(userId, { api_token}).then(({ user }) => { console.log(user.api_token)})\n```\nThe API token can be used by providing it in `x-medusa-access-token` header or you can also pass it to client libraries.\n\n2. **JWT Token**: JWT tokens are obtained by sending a request to the User Login (JWT) API Route passing it the user's email and password in the request body. For example:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://medusa-url.com/admin/auth/token' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ \"email\": \"user@example.com\", \"password\": \"supersecret\"}'\n```\nIf authenticated successfully, an object is returned in the response with the property `access_token` being the JWT token. The JWT token can be used for Bearer Authentication. It's passed in the `Authorization` header as the following: `Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}`.\n\n3. **Cookie Session ID**: You can use a cookie session to send authenticated requests. However, the specific method to do this is not detailed in the provided sources.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Medusa Admin API Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#authentication)."

      "answer": "# RAM Consumption Issue with Leapwork\n\nI understand that you're experiencing an issue with RAM consumption while using Leapwork, which is causing the studio to become unresponsive. This issue seems to occur when you're working with an Excel sheet in your flow. Let's try to address this issue step by step.\n\n## Possible Causes\n\nBased on similar issues we've encountered in the past, this problem could be due to:\n\n1. **Large Data Sets**: If your Excel sheet contains a large number of records, it could be causing a spike in RAM usage. Leapwork might be struggling to handle this large volume of data efficiently.\n\n2. **Memory Management**: There could be a potential inefficiency in memory management or data processing within Leapwork. This is suggested by the fact that the RAM does not release automatically after the execution is completed.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nHere are a few potential solutions to this issue:\n\n1. **Reduce Data Size**: If possible, try to reduce the size of the Excel sheet. This could potentially lower the RAM usage.\n\n2. **System Upgrade**: If reducing the data size is not an option, you might need to consider upgrading your system to handle larger volumes of data. This could involve increasing the RAM in your system.\n\n3. **Efficient Data Processing**: Establish a new process to manage data processing more efficiently. This could involve breaking down the data processing task into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo better understand and resolve this issue, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor RAM Usage**: Keep an eye on the RAM usage while running the flow. This could help identify any patterns or specific tasks that cause a spike in RAM usage.\n\n2. **Test with Different Data Sets**: Try running the flow with different sets of data. This could help determine if the issue is specific to the current data set or if it's a more general issue with Leapwork.\n\n3. **Contact Us for Further Assistance**: If the issue persists, please provide us with more details, such as the specific version of Leapwork you're using, the size of the Excel sheet, and any error messages you're seeing. This will help us provide more targeted assistance.\n\nI hope this helps!

The consistency of your features could be influenced by a variety of factors, including user behavior, feature implementation, and more. \n\nAmplitude provides several tools to analyze user behavior and engagement with your features. For instance, the Stickiness chart can help you understand how often users are interacting with specific features over a given period of time. This can help you identify what's driving engagement and retention, and what might be causing some users to fall short ([source](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/230901928-Stickiness-Identify-the-features-that-drive-users-back-to-your-product#01H8MVC1PA5ZZJ008SKZV8RE94)).\n\nThe Engagement Matrix can help you identify features that aren't performing well, so you can either refactor or deprecate them, and the features that are performing best, so you can find ways to extend that engagement to other areas of your product ([source](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001816407-Amplitude-s-charts-Find-the-right-one-for-your-analysis#h_01HCG1B1A4BQED65KFCNRZWVFN)).\n\nIf you're planning a phased feature rollout, you can use feature flags to allow seamless feature releases and rollbacks ([source](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061270232-Amplitude-Experiment-overview-Optimize-your-product-experience-through-A-B-testing#h_01HD2576FG1CYTX5W1T9F80QZV)).\n\nRemember, user behavior analytics can tell you what happens, but they never tell you why it happens. You can make educated guesses, but you’ll never know for sure. That’s where surveys and A/B tests come in, to complete the feedback loop ([source](https://community.amplitude.com/data-instrumentation-57/amplitude-ids-confusion-349)).\n\nI recommend exploring these tools and resources to better understand your features' performance and user engagement."

      "question": "If using wormhole I am sending USDC from ETH To polygon then what will happen.  burn mint or lock mint?",
      "answer": "When you are transferring USDC from Ethereum to Polygon using Wormhole, the process involves a lock/mint mechanism. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The USDC tokens on Ethereum (Chain A) are locked.\n2. A message is emitted indicating that the locking has been completed.\n3. This message is relayed to Polygon (Chain B).\n4. Once Chain B receives this message, it mints the corresponding amount of USDC tokens.\n\nThis process is facilitated by the generic message passing protocol provided by Wormhole, making the token bridge completely chain agnostic. As long as a Wormhole contract exists on the chain you wish to transfer to, an implementation can be quickly incorporated into the network.\n\nPlease note that Chain B (Polygon, in this case) doesn't need to know how the tokens on the sending side were locked. They could have been locked in a custody account or burned by a mint. The protocol simply relays the event once a sufficient amount of guardians have attested its existence.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Wormhole documentation](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/vaa#token-transfer)."

However, the native token ERC-20 precompiled contract on Moonbeam allows developers to interact with the native protocol token through an ERC-20 interface. This means you can interact with GLMR as if it were a native ERC-20 token.

Stacks are not removed when you take them out of your stacks code and certain stateful resources are not removed by default. This creates a case of orphaned resources. \n\nFor CloudFormation to use these resources as a part of the stack it needs the following to be true:\n\n1. The stack name of the deployment needs to be the same as the currently orphaned resource.\n2. The logical ID in the CloudFormation template for the resource is the same.\n3. The name of the resource also has to be the same.\n\nYou can check the logical ID of a resource by running `sst build` and looking at the `.sst/dist` directory for the generated CloudFormation templates.\n\nIf you are still facing issues, you might want to manually delete the stack from the AWS CloudFormation console and try deploying again.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [SST Documentation on Importing Resources](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/importing-resources#orphan-resources)."

Therefore, I can't provide a specific solution to your problem.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general steps to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Ensure that the `Flashlist` class is correctly defined and that it extends `SerializableEntity`. This is required for Serverpod to automatically handle serialization and deserialization.\n\n2. Make sure that the `Flashlist` class is correctly registered with the serialization manager. This is typically done in the `protocol.dart` file of your Serverpod application.\n\n3. If the `Flashlist` class contains complex types (like other custom classes), ensure that these types are also correctly defined and registered with the serialization manager.\n\n4. If you're using a custom serialization method for the `Flashlist` class, ensure that it's correctly implemented and registered.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues after checking these points, I recommend checking the [Serverpod documentation](https://serverpod.dev/) or asking for help in the [Serverpod GitHub repository](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod)."

      "question": "How install in sveltekit\nHow can I create a project with sveltekit and sst?",
      "answer": "Sure, here are the steps to create a project with SvelteKit and SST:\n\n1. **Create a new SvelteKit app**: You can create a new SvelteKit app using the `create-svelte` command. Run this command from the root of your SST app.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-svelte@latest\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select `SvelteKit App Server` as the deployment target. After the SvelteKit app is created, your SST app structure should look like this:\n\n```bash\nmy-sst-app  \n├─ sst.config.ts  \n├─ services  \n├─ stacks  \n└─ my-svelte-app <-- new SvelteKit app  \n ├─ src  \n ├─ static  \n └─ svelte.config.js  \n```\n\n2. **Initialize SST in your project root**: You can initialize SST in your project root using the `create-sst` command.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-sst@latest\n```\n\n3. **Set up the `svelte-kit-sst` adapter**: The `svelte-kit-sst` adapter will transform the SSR functions to a format that can be deployed to AWS. Make sure your `svelte.config.js` looks like the following.\n\n```javascript\nimport adapter from \"svelte-kit-sst\";  \nimport { vitePreprocess } from \"@sveltejs/kit/vite\";  \n  \nconst config = {  \n preprocess: vitePreprocess(),  \n kit: {  \n adapter: adapter()  \n }  \n};  \n  \nexport default config;  \n```\n\nAnd add the `svelte-kit-sst` dependency to your SvelteKit app's `package.json`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev svelte-kit-sst\n```\n\n4. **Add the `sst bind` command to your SvelteKit app's `package.json`**: `sst bind` enables you to automatically set the environment variables for your SvelteKit app directly from the outputs in your SST app.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {  \n- \"dev\": \"vite dev\",  \n+ \"dev\": \"sst bind vite dev\",  \n  \"build\": \"vite build\",  \n  \"preview\": \"vite preview\"  \n},\n```\n\n5. **Add the `SvelteKitSite` construct to an existing stack in your SST app**: You can also create a new stack for the app. When you are building your SST app, `SvelteKitSite` will invoke `npm build` inside the SvelteKit app directory. Make sure `path` is pointing to your SvelteKit app.\n\n```javascript\nimport { SvelteKitSite, StackContext } from \"sst/constructs\";  \n  \nexport default function MyStack({ stack }: StackContext) {  \n // ... existing constructs  \n  \n // Create the SvelteKit site  \n const site = new SvelteKitSite(stack, \"Site\", {  \n path: \"my-svelte-app/\",  \n });  \n  \n // Add the site's URL to stack output  \n stack.addOutputs({  \n URL: site.url,  \n });  \n}  \n```\n\nAfter the deploy succeeds, the URL will be printed out in the terminal.\n\nSources:\n- [SST Documentation - SvelteKitSite Quick Start](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/SvelteKitSite#quick-start)\n- [SST Documentation - Start with SvelteKit](https://docs.sst.dev/start/svelte)\n- [SST Tutorial - How to create a Svelte app with serverless](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-create-a-svelte-app-with-serverless.html)"

You need to create a renderer React component which renders your custom element. This can be achieved using the `createRenderer` factory function. Here is an example of how to create a renderer React component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { request } from \"graphql-request\";\nimport { createRenderer, useRenderer } from \"@webiny/app-page-builder-elements\";\n\n// The renderer React component.\nexport const SpaceX = createRenderer(() => {\n  // Let's retrieve the variables that were chosen by\n  // the user upon dropping the page element onto the page.\n  const { getElement } = useRenderer();\n  const element = getElement<SpaceXElementData>();\n  const { limit, offset, type } = element.data.variables;\n\n  const [data, setData] = useState<Spacecraft[]>([]);\n  //...\n});\n```\n[Source](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element)\n\n2. **Register Plugins**: After creating the renderer React component, you need to register it within your project’s Admin and Website apps using a couple of plugins. The plugins you need to register are `PbEditorPageElementPlugin`, `PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin`, and `PbRenderElementPlugin`. These plugins allow you to introduce your custom page element into the Page Builder’s page editor, define all the related settings that are available to users upon dropping the page element onto a page, and ensure your renderer React component is utilized upon serving a published page to an actual website visitor.\n[Source](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element)\n\n3. **Test Your Custom Page Element**: After correctly completing the above steps, you should be able to see your custom page element in Page Builder’s page editor and be able to drop it onto a page. The page element should also be correctly rendered when previewing the page, and also on the public website, once the page has been published.\n[Source](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element)\n\nFor more detailed examples, you can refer to these additional examples provided in the Webiny documentation:\n- [Cards Page Element](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/cards-page-element)\n- [Pages as Modal Content](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/pages-as-modals)\n- [Page Element With Child Elements](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/element-with-child-elements)"

      "question": "that's not what I mean.\n\nRight now I'm syncing to the destination `dataset_test`. But I eventually want to sync to destination `dataset`. I don't want to have to do a full sync for all the tables I've already tested. Can I copy the tables from `dataset_test` to `dataset`, and simply update the connections to sync to `dataset`? Or will it mess up with how Airbyte works?",
      "answer": "Based on the information provided in the knowledge sources, Airbyte does not directly support copying tables from one dataset to another as part of its data synchronization process. \n\nWhen you change the destination of a connection in Airbyte, it will typically perform a full refresh of the data. This is because Airbyte creates a new table in the destination dataset for each sync, and at the end of the sync, it drops the old table and renames the new one into place. This process ensures that the previous sync's data remains viewable for as long as possible ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/sync-modes/full-refresh-overwrite#destination-specific-mechinisims-for-full-refresh)).\n\nIf you want to avoid a full refresh when changing the destination dataset, you might consider using the \"dual writing\" method during the upgrade process. This method involves creating a new connection with the new destination and writing new incoming data simultaneously to both the old and new destinations. This approach can facilitate a smooth transition between datasets and minimize downtime in downstream systems ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2#upgrading-connections-one-by-one-with-dual-writing)).\n\nHowever, please note that manually copying tables from one dataset to another outside of Airbyte and then updating the connections to sync to the new dataset might not work as expected. This is because Airbyte maintains state information for each connection, which includes details about the data that has been synced. If you manually move the tables, this state information will not be updated accordingly, which could lead to unexpected results.\n\nTherefore, it's recommended to let Airbyte handle the data synchronization process to ensure data consistency and integrity. If you have concerns about the time or resources required for a full refresh, you might want to explore options for optimizing your sync process, such as using incremental sync modes for tables that support it."

      "answer": "To create entries in Prisma with a Next.js form, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up Prisma in your Next.js project**: Install the Prisma CLI and the Prisma client as dependencies. Initialize Prisma and create a table to model the data you want to store. Run migrations to create the database and table ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMnlyi60avU)).\n\n2. **Create a form in your Next.js application**: You can create a form in a Next.js page (e.g., `pages/admin.tsx`). In the form's `onSubmit` function, pass the form values to a mutation that will save the data to the database. If you're using GraphQL, you can define this mutation in your GraphQL server. The mutation should use the `create()` function from Prisma to create a new database record ([source](https://www.prisma.io/blog/fullstack-nextjs-graphql-prisma-3-clxbrcqppv#create-links--auth-protected-page)).\n\nHere's an example of how you might define the mutation in your GraphQL server:\n\n```javascript\n// graphql/types/Link.ts\nconst Mutation = objectType({\n  name: 'Mutation',\n  definition(t) {\n    t.field('createLink', {\n      type: 'Link',\n      args: {\n        description: stringArg(),\n        url: stringArg(),\n      },\n      resolve: (parent, { description, url }, ctx) => {\n        if (!ctx.session.userId) {\n          throw new Error('You must be logged in to create a link')\n        }\n\n        return ctx.prisma.link.create({\n          data: {\n            description,\n            url,\n            postedBy: { connect: { id: ctx.session.userId } },\n          },\n        })\n      },\n    })\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how you might create the form in your Next.js application:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/admin.tsx\nfunction AdminPage() {\n  const [createLink, { loading, error }] = useMutation(CREATE_LINK_MUTATION)\n\n  const onSubmit = async (values) => {\n    await createLink({ variables: values })\n    toast.success('Link created')\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n      {/* form fields go here */}\n      <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that these are just examples and you'll need to adjust the code to fit your specific use case."

      "answer": "Wormhole has implemented several security measures to prevent such scenarios. \n\nFirstly, Wormhole's Global Accountant is a safety feature for registered token bridges that ensures the number of wrapped tokens capable of being moved out of a chain never exceeds the number sent to that chain, even if that chain was compromised. This would limit the impact an exploit in a connected chain can have on a registered token bridge [[source](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0011_accountant.md)].\n\nSecondly, when creating accounts for new tokens, Wormhole follows certain steps to determine whether the newly created account should be a custody account or a wrapped account. If the conditions are not met, the transaction is rejected. This prevents the creation of wrapped tokens for non-existent tokens [[source](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0011_accountant.md)].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Wormhole cannot fully prevent exploits. For instance, a bug in a smart contract allowing minting of unbacked wrapped assets could be exploited by an attacker. The attacker might swap these wrapped assets into other valuable assets through other protocols or through exchanges without going through Wormhole [[source](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0011_accountant.md)].\n\nTherefore, users should always exercise caution when dealing with tokens, especially those that are not widely recognized or traded."

      "answer": "To query an inverse `hasOne` relationship in Strapi, you would need to define the relationship in your models first. For example, if you have a `hasOne` relationship between `Question` and `Answer` models, you would define this in your `schema.json` files for each model.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define this in your `Question` model:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"attributes\": {\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"answer\": {\n      \"type\": \"relation\",\n      \"relation\": \"oneToOne\",\n      \"target\": \"api::answer.answer\",\n      \"inversedBy\": \"question\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your `Answer` model:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"attributes\": {\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"question\": {\n      \"type\": \"relation\",\n      \"relation\": \"oneToOne\",\n      \"target\": \"api::question.question\",\n      \"inversedBy\": \"answer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Question` model has a `hasOne` relationship with the `Answer` model, and the `Answer` model has an inverse `hasOne` relationship with the `Question` model.\n\nOnce you've defined your relationships, you can then query them using Strapi's query API. For example, to get a question along with its answer, you might do something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst questionWithAnswer = await strapi.services.question.findOne({ id: 1 });\n```\n\nThis will return the question with the ID of 1, along with its associated answer.\n\nPlease note that the exact syntax and method for querying may vary depending on your specific use case and Strapi setup.\n\nSources:\n- [Understanding and Using Relations in Strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/understanding-and-using-relations-in-strapi)\n- [MongoDB vs. SQL implementation differences in Strapi v3](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/migration/v3-to-v4/data/mongo-sql-cheatsheet#relations)"

      "question": "If Airbyte spins up two docker containers or workers per sync job, isn't this approach slow to sync every minute?",
      "answer": "Airbyte's approach to data synchronization involves spinning up two workers per sync job, one for reading from the source and the other for writing to the destination. This approach is designed to efficiently handle data transfer between different sources and destinations. However, the actual speed of synchronization can depend on several factors, including the resources allocated to the workers and the complexity of the data being transferred.\n\nIn a Docker deployment, an Airbyte worker spins up at least one Docker container to do the actual work. The performance of each worker and, consequently, the speed of synchronization can be influenced by the resources (memory and disk space) allocated to the Docker container running the jobs. Therefore, ensuring that the Docker container has sufficient resources is crucial for efficient data synchronization ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/scaling-airbyte#what-to-scale)).\n\nMoreover, the number of concurrent jobs that a worker can handle is also a factor. By default, each worker can accommodate 10 concurrent jobs. If your jobs take a long time, it's possible that the ports will not be reclaimed fast enough for new syncs. In such cases, increasing the number of worker replicas can help ([source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/24277)).\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there have been instances where users have reported more frequent syncs than their cron settings. This could be due to various reasons, including networking source connection failures or issues with port reclamation after a sync ends ([source](https://discuss.airbyte.io/t/4268)).\n\nIn conclusion, while Airbyte's approach involves spinning up two workers per sync job, the actual speed of synchronization can vary based on several factors. If you're experiencing slow syncs, it might be worth looking into the resources allocated to your workers, the number of concurrent jobs your workers are handling, and your cron settings."

Also, consider using the latest version of IQ Server in your test environment and N-1 version in your production environment to limit risk and ensure stability.\n\nFor specific monitoring tools like Dynatrace, there are no specific recommendations documented. However, some general things to monitor would be max heap used consistently, unexplained ERROR level log messages in the clm-server.log, consistent unexplained sustained high CPU that is noticeably different from measured norms, and HTTP GET requests that take minutes to respond with no obvious reasons. Also, keep an eye on memory saturation and consider allocating more JVM heap to your IQ server if memory saturation events occur.\n\nSources: \n- [General Lifecycle Best Practices](https://help.sonatype.com/en/general-lifecycle-best-practices.html)\n- [Zendesk Ticket (closed): Recommendations for Dynatrace monitoring for IQ servers Part 1](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/65957)\n- [Zendesk Ticket (closed): Recommendations for Dynatrace monitoring for IQ servers Part 3](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/65957)"

However, there are some considerations to keep in mind. \n\nFirstly, the number of dynamic child blocks that can be executed in parallel may be limited by the concurrency settings of your environment. For example, a user reported an issue on the Slack forum where they were unable to execute more than 100 parallel dynamic blocks with a max concurrency setting of 30 in a Windows environment. The issue was not reproducible with 10 or 20 child items ([source](https://slack.com/archives/C03HTTWFEKE/p1708979830666909)).\n\nSecondly, there have been reported issues with dynamic child blocks not executing correctly under certain conditions.

      "answer": "Hazelcast offers both AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) and CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance) data structures, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.\n\n**AP IMap:**\n- **Pros:**\n  - High availability: All working members in a distributed system return a valid response to any request, without exceptions.\n  - Partition tolerance: The system continues to work despite any number of communication breakdowns between the members of the cluster.\n  - High throughput: The replication algorithm for AP data structures enables Hazelcast clusters to offer high throughput.\n  - Lazy replication: When the primary replica receives an update operation for a key, it executes the update locally and propagates it to backup replicas. This allows backup replicas to be used to scale reads with no strong consistency but monotonic reads guarantee.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Inconsistency: In the event of a communication breakdown, some members affected by the partition might return an older version of data than others. However, Hazelcast typically synchronizes the members to repair all inconsistencies in the system when the partition is resolved.\n  - Replication lag: Backup replicas can miss some updates and diverge from the primary due to temporary situations in the system, such as network interruption or VM or long GC pauses.\n\n**CP Map:**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Consistency: All the clients connected to the system see the same data at the same time, no matter which member they connect to; whenever data is written to a member, it is instantly replicated to all the other members in the system.\n  - Partition tolerance: The system continues to work despite any number of communication breakdowns between the members of the cluster.\n  - Durability: In a CP system, once a replica performs an update locally (i.e., commits the update), the underlying consensus algorithm guarantees durability of the update for the rest of the execution.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Availability: When a partition occurs between any members, Hazelcast makes the non-consistent member unavailable until the partition is resolved. This means that in certain scenarios, a CP system may sacrifice availability to ensure consistency and partition tolerance.\n\nIn summary, the choice between AP and CP data structures depends on the specific requirements of your use case. If high availability is a priority, an AP IMap may be more suitable. If strong consistency is required, a CP Map would be a better choice.\n\nSources:\n- [Hazelcast Architecture](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/architecture/architecture#apcp)\n- [Hazelcast FAQ](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/faq)\n- [Data Partitioning and Replication](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/architecture/data-partitioning#best-effort-consistency)\n- [CP Subsystem Configuration](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/cp-subsystem/configuration#persistence)"

      "answer": "Camunda 8 uses various log levels such as TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR. Each of these levels provides different types of information, and not all messages require action. \n\nTo set the default log level for different components of Camunda 8, you can follow the instructions provided in the documentation:\n\n- For **Zeebe**, you can modify the `config/log4j2.xml` file in the distribution or the docker image. The log level can be set dynamically using a `POST` request to the `/actuator/loggers/{logger.name}` endpoint. For example, to set the log level to DEBUG, you can use the following command:\n```bash\ncurl 'http://localhost:9600/actuator/loggers/io.camunda.zeebe' -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"configuredLevel\":\"debug\"}'\n```\n[Source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration#logging)\n\n- For **Operate** and **Tasklist**, you can change the log level by following the instructions provided by Spring Boot. To set all loggers to DEBUG, you can use the following command:\n```bash\ncurl 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/io.camunda.operate' -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"configuredLevel\":\"debug\"}'\n```\n[Operate Source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/operate-deployment/operate-configuration#change-logging-level-at-runtime)\n[Tasklist Source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration#change-logging-level-at-runtime)\n\n- For **Optimize**, you can adjust the log level using the `environment-logback.xml` configuration file.

By default, the `placement` prop is set to `auto`, which means the Modal component will automatically adjust its position based on the available space. \n\nHowever, there are known issues with the Modal component's placement and scroll behavior, especially when used together. For instance, when `scrollBehavior='outside'` and `placement='bottom'` are used together, the `placement` property does not take effect. Regardless of the `placement` value set, the behavior remains the same, with a distance from the top, and a scroll-down state. This issue is currently open on the NextUI GitHub repository ([source](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/issues/1548)).\n\nIf you're experiencing this issue, you might want to try adjusting the `placement` prop or the `scrollBehavior` prop, or follow the updates on the issue linked above."

      "answer": "Yes, Ray can be used to parallelize and distribute Python code, including libraries like Scipy. Ray is a fast, simple distributed execution framework that makes it easy to scale your applications and to leverage state of the art machine learning libraries. Using Ray, you can take Python code that runs sequentially and transform it into a distributed application with minimal code changes.\n\nTo use Ray, you need to start all of the relevant Ray processes using `ray.init()`. By default, Ray creates one worker process per CPU core. If you want to run Ray on a cluster, you would need to pass in a cluster address with something like `ray.init(address='insertAddressHere')`.\n\nTo create a Ray task, you can decorate a normal Python function with the `@ray.remote` decorator. This creates a task which can be scheduled across your laptop’s CPU cores (or Ray cluster).\n\nHere's an example of how to use Ray:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_scipy_function(input_data):\n    # Your scipy code here\n    return result\n\n# Call the function\nfuture = some_scipy_function.remote(input_data)\n\n# Get the result\nresult = ray.get(future)\n```\n\nIn this example, `some_scipy_function` is a placeholder for a function that uses Scipy. You would replace this with your actual function.\n\nPlease note that while Ray can parallelize and distribute your Scipy code, the actual performance gain depends on the nature of your computation. If your computation is inherently sequential or if it doesn't benefit from parallelization, then you might not see a significant speedup.\n\nSources:\n- [Writing your First Distributed Python Application with Ray](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/writing-your-first-distributed-python-application-with-ray)\n- [Parallelizing Python Code](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/parallelizing-python-code)"

      "answer": "Sonatype vulnerability IDs are identifiers assigned by Sonatype to vulnerabilities that lack a CVE identifier at the time of their discovery. These IDs are reported when viewing an IQ Server evaluation report. Sonatype ingests vulnerability information from a variety of sources, including GitHub advisories, feeds, blogs, and occasionally their Security Research team's own findings. \n\nThe proprietary Sonatype-XXXX-YYYY identifier is assigned, where XXXX is the year the vulnerability was publicly disclosed and YYYY is the vulnerability number, unique in that year. If a CVE ID is later assigned to a vulnerability that already has a Sonatype ID, the original Sonatype ID is not removed. Instead, a note is added to the Explanation section of the data with the CVE ID. This is done to prevent duplicate notifications and the need for customers to repeatedly waive violations.\n\nIn some cases, such as vulnerabilities reported to OSS projects via their GitHub \"Issues\" section, a CVE ID is almost never requested by the project developers/vulnerability reporters and never assigned. The assignment of a Sonatype ID facilitates the cataloging of such vulnerabilities much quicker and prevents duplicates. \n\nSonatype IDs are also used when the automated malware detection systems find malicious/suspicious components. In such cases, Sonatype does not wait for a CVE assignment and provides data on malicious components and vulnerabilities much faster by using Sonatype IDs.\n\nYou can look up vulnerability details by entering any known vulnerability ID from the vulnerability lookup page or Vulnerability Details REST API. The vulnerability ID could be a Sonatype ID or just the CVE ID.\n\n[Source](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975343123-What-are-Sonatype-vulnerability-IDs)"

This is not recommended as per the Next.js documentation and the discussions in the GitHub issues you've mentioned.\n\nIn Next.js, data fetching should be handled differently depending on whether it's on the client-side or server-side. For client-side, you should use the `useEffect` hook or a data fetching library like SWR. For server-side, you can use data fetching functions like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.\n\nIn your case, since `getCategories` is a server-side function, you should consider fetching the data in a server-side context and pass it as props to your client component. Here's an example from one of the GitHub issues:\n\n```jsx\n// app/page.jsx\nimport { use } from 'react';\nimport { ProductCard } from './product-card';\n\nconst Index = () => {\n  const product = use(\n    fetch('https://dummyjson.com/products/1').then((res) => res.json())\n  );\n\n  return <ProductCard title={product.title} />;\n};\n\nexport default Index;\n\n// app/product-card.jsx\n'use client';\n\nexport function ProductCard({title}) {\n  return <div>{title}</div>;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the data is fetched in the server component and passed as props to the client component.\n\nIf you want to fetch data on the client-side, you can use the `useEffect` hook as shown in the Next.js documentation:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nfunction Profile() {\n const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n \n useEffect(() => {\n fetch('/api/profile-data')\n .then((res) => res.json())\n .then((data) => {\n setData(data)\n setLoading(false)\n })\n }, [])\n \n if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n if (!data) return <p>No profile data</p>\n \n return (\n <div>\n <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n <p>{data.bio}</p>\n </div>\n )\n}\n```\nIn this example, the data is fetched at the time of the component mount, and the content of the component is updated as the data changes.\n\nSources:\n- [Next.js Documentation - Client-side Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side)\n- [GitHub Issue - React's use() hook does not work](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46084)\n- [Next.js Documentation - Client-side Rendering (CSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering)"

      "answer": "In terms of licensing for Portainer Business Edition, a \"node\" is defined as a \"server\" that is capable of running containers via Docker, Kubernetes, or another orchestrator. This server can be a physical server, a virtual machine (VM), a Raspberry Pi, a desktop or laptop, an industrial computer, or an embedded compute device. A node is either running the Portainer Server or is under the management of a Portainer Server installation.\n\nFor Docker, anything that runs Portainer, whether that be Portainer Server or Portainer Agent, is considered a node. This is important to remember as on clustered environments like Docker Swarm, the Portainer Agent will be running on each server in the cluster and therefore count towards your number of licenses. If you are managing a Swarm cluster without using the Portainer Agent, those nodes will still count toward the number of licensed nodes. If it runs Docker-CE, is a Kubelet, or is a serverless endpoint and you manage it with Portainer, it counts as a node.\n\nFor example, if you are running a small setup consisting of three Docker Standalone servers. One of these servers is hosting the Portainer Server container, and the other two are managed from the Portainer Server container using the Portainer Agent. In this scenario, Portainer is running in three places (one Server and two Agents) so would need a 3 node license.\n\nNode pricing is also dependent on the type of node you are using. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [knowledge base article](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes) on Portainer's website."

      "answer": "To create an item from a received email without getting duplicates, you can use the monday.com API to first check if an item with the same email already exists on the board. If it doesn't, you can then create a new item.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Use the `items_by_column_values` API call to check if an item with the same email already exists. This call can be slow on large boards, so it might be faster to get all the data from the board and filter it in your app. Here's an example of how to get all the data from a board using GraphQL:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  boards (ids: 1234567891) {\n    name\n    items (limit:100) {\n      id\n      name\n      column_values {\n        text\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n(Source: [Development Best Practices](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/development-best-practices))\n\n2. If the item doesn't exist, you can create a new item using the `create_item` mutation. However, keep in mind that you cannot create more than 10 to 20 items in real time, and each `create_item` mutation uses 10,000 complexity points. This means you can make ~160 items per minute to avoid hitting the complexity limit. If you need to create more items, you'll need to queue your mutations.\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  create_item (board_id: 1234567891, item_name: \"New Item\", column_values: \"{\\\"email\\\" : \\\"example@email.com\\\"}\") {\n    id\n  }\n}\n```\n(Source: [Built-in Actions](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/monday-action-blocks))\n\nRemember to replace `1234567891` with your actual board ID and `example@email.com` with the actual email address.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and you might need to adjust it according to your specific use case and environment."

However, you can define the shell at the `job` level instead of the `run` level to apply certain shell options to all commands in a job. This can be done by following the instructions in the [CircleCI configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#job_name) [^1^].\n\nIf you find yourself repeating the same steps across multiple jobs, you might consider using [Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/orbs-best-practices#consider-post-and-pre-steps-and-step-parameters). Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that condense repeated pieces of config into a single line of code.

      "question": "How to fill database with data on initialization ",
      "answer": "To fill your database with data on initialization, you can use Serverpod's migration system. Migrations are written in SQL and can be used to add data to the database. This can be particularly useful if you want to add initial data to your database. However, you are responsible for ensuring that any added SQL statements are compatible with the database schema and rolling forward from the previous migrations [source](https://docs.serverpod.dev/concepts/database/migrations#add-data-in-a-migration).\n\nHere are the steps to create a migration:\n\n1. Navigate to your project's `server` package directory and run the `generate` command.\n```bash\n$ serverpod generate  \n```\n2. Create a migration for your project. The migration system will create a migration as if the database needs to be initialized from scratch. Run the `create-migration` command.\n```bash\n$ serverpod create-migration  \n```\n[source](https://docs.serverpod.dev/upgrading/upgrade-to-one-point-two#data-to-preserve)\n\nIn the migration file, you can add SQL statements to insert data into your tables. Once you've created the migration, you can apply it to your database using the `--apply-migrations` flag when starting the server.\n```bash\n$ dart run bin/main.dart --apply-migrations  \n```\n[source](https://docs.serverpod.dev/get-started#working-with-the-database)\n\nRemember, any time you update the table definitions or want to add new data, you have to create a new migration and apply it to the database to update the database schema [source](https://docs.serverpod.dev/tutorials/first-app#create-database-tables)."

      "answer": "Daily can be integrated into React applications using the `daily-js` library, which is designed to be flexible and easily integrated into any app. You can use Daily's APIs to create and manage rooms, control meeting access with tokens, and analyze session data. For more specific implementations, you can refer to Daily's React tutorials on their blog, which include both Daily Prebuilt and custom examples [^1^].\n\nTo persist the session, you can use Daily's custom session data feature. This feature allows developers to store state at the level of a video call session. It simplifies per-session state, catering to common needs like stateful UIs, client-synced layout changes, and engagement features (such as polls or breakout rooms) without additional infrastructure [^2^].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that custom session data is not available in Daily Prebuilt at this time. It is available for call-object based implementations using `daily-js` [^3^].\n\nIf you need to handle sensitive data which requires an API key or other secret to access, or data which requires additional validation outside of any one client’s control, or data which might need additional processing that you want to offload to a server for performance reasons, you can use your own server component for state handling and communicating relevant state to call participants [^4^].\n\nFor database persistence, you would typically handle this on your server-side, storing the relevant data in your database as needed. This could be done in response to certain events or actions within your application.\n\n[^1^]: [Using Daily APIs in React applications](https://docs.daily.co/guides/frameworks/react)\n[^2^]: [When and how to use Daily’s new custom session data feature](https://www.daily.co/blog/when-and-how-to-use-dailys-new-custom-session-data-feature)\n[^3^]: [Use cases for custom session data](https://www.daily.co/blog/when-and-how-to-use-dailys-new-custom-session-data-feature#use-cases-for-custom-session-data)\n[^4^]: [When to use a server component](https://www.daily.co/blog/when-and-how-to-use-dailys-new-custom-session-data-feature#when-to-use-a-server-component)"

      "answer": "In YugabyteDB, sharding is an automatic process that is controlled at the storage level. This means that shards are automatically placed on different nodes in the YugabyteDB cluster. As your data grows in size, the database will continue to create more shards and distribute them across your cluster. When you add nodes, the database will replicate the shards to the new nodes. This allows you to horizontally scale out with no effort to meet your high throughput requirements. This is a key concept in how YugabyteDB achieves horizontal write scalability that native PostgreSQL lacks. Additional nodes lead to the shards getting rebalanced across all the nodes so that the additional compute capacity can be more thoroughly utilized[^1^][^3^].\n\nIt's important to note that while PostgreSQL has a concept of \"partitioned tables\" that can make sharding confusing, this is not the same as the auto-sharding in YugabyteDB. In PostgreSQL, partitioned tables enable a single table to be broken into multiple child tables that can be stored on separate disks. However, serving of the data is still performed by a single node, which does not offer the benefits of an auto-sharded distributed database such as YugabyteDB[^1^].\n\n[^1^]: [Documentation > Preview > Faq > Comparisons > PostgreSQL > The basics](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/faq/comparisons/postgresql#the-basics)\n[^3^]: [Blog > What Is the Difference Between ‘Table Partitioning’ and ‘Sharding’ In a Distributed SQL Deployment?

      "question": "Worker definition and how many of them?",
      "answer": "A Worker in Temporal is an individual entity within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue. It contains a Workflow Worker and/or an Activity Worker, which makes progress on Workflow Executions and Activity Executions, respectively. Workers are stateless, so any Workflow Execution in a blocked state can be safely removed from a Worker. Later on, it can be resurrected on the same or different Worker when the need arises (in the form of an external event). Therefore, a single Worker can handle millions of open Workflow Executions, assuming it can handle the update rate and that a slightly higher latency is not a concern [[source](https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-entity)].\n\nWhen creating the worker, there are two configurations to keep in mind: `MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers` and `MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers`. These configurations determine how many pollers the worker uses to poll and execute tasks from the server. The default is 2, which may not be enough depending on your application's needs [[source](https://community.temporal.io/t/918)].\n\n```javascript\nworker.Options{\n\t...\n\tMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers: 40,\n\tMaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers: 40,\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nStriking the balance of having the right amount of Workers can be tricky. When you don’t have enough Workers, your Workflows can stall, slow down, or possibly never finish. When you have too many Workers, at best you’re paying too much for compute resources; at worst, your Workers are rate limited, denying them the ability to poll for new Tasks [[source](https://temporal.io/blog/an-introduction-to-worker-tuning)]."

      "question": "my portainer instance stopped connecting to agent on another instance. Both are on bu do not see each other",
      "answer": "There could be several reasons why your Portainer instance is not connecting to the agent on another instance. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. **Network Configuration**: Ensure that the network configuration is correct. If you are running on a VMware environment or a hosting provider like Hetzner, the network used to communicate between nodes might use a MTU that is not 1500, which is Docker Swarm's default network MTU. If the underlying network has a lower MTU than this, the Swarm nodes may fail to communicate with each other. You can adjust Docker Swarm's MTU to match that of the underlying network. You can find the MTU of your network using the command `ip a` on Linux. To use the new MTU, you will need to remove and recreate the ingress network with the new value using the following commands:\n   ```\n   docker network rm ingress  \n   docker network create -d overlay --ingress --opt com.docker.network.driver.mtu=1450 ingress\n   ```\n   Then, when you are creating new networks you will need to set the MTU to match ([source](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/why-cant-my-agents-communicate-with-portainer-on-swarm)).\n\n2. **Firewall and Routing Setup**: The Portainer Server instance needs to be reachable from the Edge Agent instance on ports `9443` and `8000`. You'll need to ensure that the address of the Edge Agent machine is allowed through the Portainer Server machine's firewall on these ports ([source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/11323)).\n\n3. **Edge Agent Configuration**: If your Portainer Server instance is deployed with TLS, the agent will use HTTPS for the connection it makes back to Portainer. However, if your Portainer instance uses a self-signed certificate, the Edge Agent must be deployed with the `-e EDGE_INSECURE_POLL=1` flag. If you do not deploy the Edge Agent with this flag, then the agent will not be able to communicate with the Portainer Server instance ([source](https://docs.portainer.io/admin/environments/add/docker/edge#preparation), [source](https://docs.portainer.io/admin/environments/add/swarm/edge#preparation)).\n\n4. **Join Token**: The agent communicates with Portainer using a join token. Portainer checks its database to ensure the Edge UUID and the join token match. If the UUID/join token do not match, the connection is rejected ([source](https://docs.portainer.io/advanced/edge-agent#connection-process-and-checks)).\n\nIf you've checked all of these and are still having issues, it might be helpful to look at the logs for any error messages."

      "answer": "To insert a new row with the current date and time and set the price of the premium bat to 99.99, you would use the `INSERT INTO` statement. However, the exact SQL command would depend on the structure of your table. \n\nAssuming you have a table named `products` with columns `product_name`, `price`, and `last_updated`, you could use the following command:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO products (product_name, price, last_updated) VALUES ('premium bat', 99.99, now());\n```\n\nThis command inserts a new row into the `products` table. The `product_name` is set to 'premium bat', the `price` is set to 99.99, and the `last_updated` timestamp is set to the current date and time using the `now()` function.\n\nPlease replace `products`, `product_name`, `price`, and `last_updated` with your actual table name and column names.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [CockroachDB documentation on inserting rows](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/learn-cockroachdb-sql#insert-rows)."

      "question": "How to setup repository manager HA",
      "answer": "Setting up High Availability (HA) for the Nexus Repository Manager involves several steps. Here's a general guide:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: High Availability Clustering is a legacy feature that only works on the Orient database. All new deployments should use one of the new high availability or resilient deployment options. Before you begin, ensure you have read and prepared your choices for Configuring Storage, Configuring Hazelcast, and Designing your Cluster Backup/Restore Process. Once you begin, focus on stabilizing one single node at a time. [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/initial-setup---high-availability-clustering--legacy-.html)\n\n2. **First Node Setup**: Follow the usual Installation Methods. Create the `sonatype-work/nexus3/etc/nexus.properties` file with the necessary contents. Deploy your chosen hazelcast configuration to the path `sonatype-work/nexus3/etc/fabric/hazelcast-network.xml`. Start Nexus Repository Manager. Log in as an administrator, then visit the System → Nodes screen. You should see your first node. [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/initial-setup---high-availability-clustering--legacy-.html)\n\n3. **Second Node and Beyond**: Do not copy the `sonatype-work` directory to your additional nodes. Each node must be allowed to initialize its own private `sonatype-work` directory. Starting a second node off of a copy of the `sonatype-work` directory will result in the inability to correctly form a cluster. Follow the usual Installation Methods. Before starting Nexus Repository Manager, repeat the steps you performed on the first node. [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/initial-setup---high-availability-clustering--legacy-.html)\n\n4. **Enabling High Availability on an existing Nexus Repository Manager Deployment**: If you already have a single node Nexus Repository Manager deployment, you will still need to read and prepare your choices for Configuring Storage, Configuring Hazelcast, and Designing your Cluster Backup/Restore Process. You will also need to upgrade your single node deployment to a version of Nexus Repository Manager that supports High Availability Clustering (Legacy) before you attempt to establish a cluster. [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/initial-setup---high-availability-clustering--legacy-.html)\n\n5. **Blob Store Content Migration**: All blob stores used by HA-C nodes must be shared. If you need to move blobstore blobs to new blobstores in preparation for sharing between nodes, first perform that procedure in a single node configuration using the Dynamic Storage operations. [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/initial-setup---high-availability-clustering--legacy-.html)\n\nPlease note that these steps are for the legacy High Availability Clustering feature. For new deployments, consider using the HA/Resiliency Helm Chart for Kubernetes or Azure.

      "question": "How to store a list of items in an AstroDB column?\nsee title for question",
      "answer": "Astro DB allows you to store a list of items in a column using the `column.json()` type. This type allows you to store arbitrary JSON blobs, which can be an array of items. Here's an example of how you can define a column to store a list of items:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineTable, column } from 'astro:db';\n\nconst Comment = defineTable({\n  columns: {\n    // Other columns...\n    items: column.json(),\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `items` column can store a JSON array of items. When you insert data into this table, you can provide a JSON array for the `items` column.\n\nPlease note that the data stored in a `column.json()` type is parsed as stringified JSON for data storage. This means that you'll need to parse the JSON when you retrieve the data from the database.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Astro DB documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#table-configuration-reference)."

      "answer": "In the raw tables of Destination V2 in Airbyte, the fields `_airbyte_loaded_at` and `_airbyte_extracted_at` have specific definitions:\n\n- `_airbyte_extracted_at`: This is a timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source. It represents the time that the source query executed, which is defined by the source connector as \"the time when we extracted the data\". For database sources, it is the timestamp when the `select` query started running. In the context of legacy normalization, `extracted_at` is equivalent to the old `_airbyte_emitted_at` [source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/25194).\n\n- `_airbyte_loaded_at`: This is a timestamp representing when the row was processed into the final table. It is the time when data was inserted into the destination, which is more akin to the time that the record was synced. In the context of legacy normalization, `loaded_at` is equivalent to `_airbyte_normalized_at` [source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/25194).\n\nThese fields are present in the raw tables for various destinations like Redshift, Snowflake, and BigQuery [source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/redshift#output-schema), [source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/snowflake#output-schema), [source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#output-schema)."

      "answer": "Yes, there is a maximum recommended storage capacity per node in CockroachDB, which is 10 TiB, regardless of the number of vCPUs. This recommendation is for provisioning volumes with 320 GiB per vCPU. It's fine to have less storage per vCPU if your workload does not have significant capacity needs. Always keep some of your disk capacity free on production to accommodate fluctuations in routine database operations and support continuous data growth. It's also important to monitor your storage utilization and rate of growth, and take action to add capacity well before you hit the limit [^1^].\n\nFor CockroachDB Serverless clusters, all non-contract CockroachDB Cloud organizations are given 50M RUs and 10 GiB of storage for free each month. If you reach your storage limit, your cluster will be throttled and you will only be able to delete data or increase your storage limit [^2^].\n\n> It might be helpful to talk to our sales team for more detailed information and guidance based on your specific use case.

First, you need to import the necessary libraries and define the `compute_embedding` and `get_chunks` functions:\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.chunking.title import chunk_by_title  \nfrom unstructured.documents.elements import DataSourceMetadata  \nfrom unstructured.partition.json import partition_json  \nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nembedding_model = SentenceTransformer(embedding_model_name, device=device)\n\ndef compute_embedding(chunk_text: List[str]):  \n    embeddings = embedding_model.encode(chunk_text, device=device)  \n    return embeddings\n\ndef get_chunks(elements, chunk_under_n_chars=500, chunk_new_after_n_chars=1500):  \n    for element in elements:  \n        if not type(element.metadata.data_source) is DataSourceMetadata:  \n            delattr(element.metadata, \"data_source\")\n        if hasattr(element.metadata, \"coordinates\"):  \n            delattr(element.metadata, \"coordinates\")\n    chunks = chunk_by_title(elements, combine_under_n_chars=chunk_under_n_chars, new_after_n_chars=chunk_new_after_n_chars)\n    for i in range(len(chunks)):  \n        chunks[i] = {\"last_modified\": chunks[i].metadata.last_modified, \"text\": chunks[i].text}\n    chunk_texts = [x['text'] for x in chunks]  \n    embeddings = compute_embedding(chunk_texts)  \n    return chunks, embeddings\n```\n\n2. Then, you can use the `add_data_to_weaviate` function to add the chunks to your database:\n\n```python\ndef add_data_to_weaviate(files, client, chunk_under_n_chars=500, chunk_new_after_n_chars=1500):  \n    for filename in files:  \n        try:  \n            elements = partition_json(filename=filename)  \n            chunks, embeddings = get_chunks(elements, chunk_under_n_chars, chunk_new_after_n_chars)  \n        except IndexError as e:  \n            print(e)  \n            continue\n        print(f\"Uploading {len(chunks)} chunks for {str(filename)}.\")  \n        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):  \n            client.batch.add_data_object(data_object=chunk, class_name=\"doc\", uuid=get_valid_uuid(uuid.uuid4()), vector=embeddings[i])\n        client.batch.flush()\n```\n\nThis process will transform the output from `chunk_by_title` into document objects that can be added to your database."

This can be useful when you want to wait for new messages or signals before proceeding with the workflow execution.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `Workflow.sleep` in Java:\n\n```java\nWorkflow.sleep(Duration.ofDays(30));\n```\n\nIn this example, the workflow will pause for 30 days before proceeding. If any new messages or signals are received during this time, they will be processed after the sleep period is over.\n\nIf you're using PHP, you can use `Workflow::timer` instead of the native PHP `sleep()` function. This is because `Workflow::timer` is safer as it is persisted to Temporal Server with a server-side timer. If any part of your system crashes, then after restart it will continue right from the crash and not from scratch.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `Workflow::timer` in PHP:\n\n```php\nyield Workflow::timer(86400 * 30); // wait for 30 days\n```\n\nIn this example, the workflow will pause for 30 days before proceeding. If any new messages or signals are received during this time, they will be processed after the timer period is over.\n\nRemember, the workflow code must be deterministic in order to safely rerun.

      "question": "Can you summarize the functions available in the avalanche node api?",
      "answer": "Avalanche provides a public API server that allows developers to interact with the Avalanche network without having to run a node themselves. The public API server is a set of AvalancheGo nodes behind a load balancer to ensure high availability and high request throughput. The usage of public API nodes is free and available to everyone without any authentication or authorization. Rate limiting is present, but many of the API calls are cached, and the rate limits are quite high.\n\nThe APIs currently supported by default are:\n- Admin API\n- Auth API\n- AVM API (X-Chain)\n- EVM API (C-Chain)\n- Health API\n- Index API\n- Info API\n- Keystore API\n- Metrics API\n- PlatformVM API\n- Socket API\n\nTo access a particular API, you append the relevant API endpoint to the base URL. For example, for the C-Chain API, the URL is `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`.\n\nUsing these APIs, developers can perform a variety of actions such as retrieving balances on addresses, getting UTXOs for addresses, building and signing transactions, issuing signed transactions to the X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain, performing cross-chain swaps between the X, P and C chains, adding Validators and Delegators, and creating Subnets and Blockchains.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Avalanche API documentation](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/issuing-api-calls) and the [AvalancheJS documentation](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanchejs-overview).\n\nSources:\n- [What APIs are available on Avalanche?](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6159007-what-apis-are-available-on-avalanche)\n- [AvalancheJS Overview](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanchejs-overview)\n- [What is Avalanche JS?](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6159048-what-is-avalanche-js)"

      "question": "acid transactions",
      "answer": "CockroachDB provides strict guarantees on transactions by adhering to ACID properties. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n\n- **Atomicity**: Transactions in CockroachDB are \"all or nothing.\" If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database is left unchanged. If a transaction succeeds, all mutations are applied together with virtual simultaneity. \n\n- **Consistency**: SQL operations never see any intermediate states and move the database from one valid state to another, keeping indexes up to date. Operations always see the results of previously completed statements on overlapping data and maintain specified constraints such as unique columns.\n\n- **Isolation**: By default, transactions in CockroachDB implement the strongest ANSI isolation level: serializable (`SERIALIZABLE`). This means that transactions will never result in anomalies. However, CockroachDB can also be configured to execute transactions at `READ COMMITTED` isolation, which permits some concurrency anomalies in exchange for minimizing transaction aborts and retries.\n\n- **Durability**: In CockroachDB, every acknowledged write has been persisted consistently on a majority of replicas (by default, at least 2) via the Raft consensus algorithm. Power or disk failures that affect only a minority of replicas (typically 1) do not prevent the cluster from operating and do not lose any data.\n\nAll data access in CockroachDB is transactional, ensuring data integrity and consistency due to its strict ACID guarantees. This applies to all transactions, regardless of data distribution. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [CockroachDB ACID Transactions Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6zbQ5_sgq8)\n- [CockroachDB Transactions Documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions)\n- [CockroachDB Developer Basics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/developer-basics#how-transactions-work-in-cockroachdb)\n- [CockroachDB Architecture: Transaction Layer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/transaction-layer)\n- [CockroachDB Isolation Levels](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions#isolation-levels)"

      "question": "What is the best way to use ory network with golang backend and react front end? The project is simply a dashboard for end users",
      "answer": "To use Ory Network with a Golang backend and React frontend, you would need to integrate authentication into both your Golang and React applications. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Install Ory CLI**: The Ory CLI provides a convenient way to configure and manage projects. It contains Ory Proxy, a reverse proxy that rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently on. Follow [this guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation) to install the Ory CLI on your machine.\n\n2. **Integrate Authentication into your Golang Application**: \n\n   - Clone and run Ory Kratos locally using the following commands:\n     ```\n     git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/ory/kratos.git  \n     cd kratos  \n     git checkout master  \n     git pull -ff  \n     docker-compose -f quickstart.yml -f contrib/quickstart/kratos/cloud/quickstart.yml up --build --force-recreate -d  \n     ```\n   - Set the environment variable to the exposed port:\n     ```\n     export ORY_SDK_URL=http://localhost:4433  \n     ```\n   - Run the Ory proxy to mirror the Ory API endpoints on your application's domain (`localhost`):\n     ```\n     ory proxy http://localhost:3000  \n     ```\n   - Open <http://localhost:4000> to access the application. As the initial call is made by an unauthenticated user, the middleware doesn't detect a valid session and redirects to the login page of the defined Ory project. From there, you can create a new account or sign in using an existing identity. When you sign in, the session becomes valid and the application shows the `Dashboard` page with the session data.\n\n3. **Integrate Authentication into your React Application**: \n\n   - Set the environment variable to the exposed port:\n     ```\n     export ORY_SDK_URL=http://localhost:4433  \n     ```\n   - Start the React development server:\n     ```\n     npm run start  \n     ```\n   - Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. After loading, you now are presented with Ory's Sign In page. Let's click on sign up and create your first user.\n\n4. **Go to Production**: You can deploy your application on Kubernetes, AWS, a VM, a RaspberryPi, etc. To connect the application to your Ory project, the app and Ory APIs must be available under the same common domain. You can easily connect Ory to your subdomain by adding a Custom Domain to your Ory Network project. With the custom domain set up, you don't need to use Ory Proxy or Ory Tunnel to interact with Ory APIs. Instead, use the configured custom domain in your SDK calls.\n\nFor Golang:\n```\n// register a new Ory client with the URL set to the Ory CLI Proxy  \n// we can also read the URL from the env or a config file  \nc := ory.NewConfiguration()  \nc.Servers = ory.ServerConfigurations{{URL: \"https://ory.example.org\"}}  \n```\nFor React:\n```\nvar sdk = require(\"@ory/client\")  \n  \nvar ory = new sdk.FrontendApi(  \n new sdk.Configuration({  \n basePath: \"https://ory.example.org\",  \n baseOptions: {  \n // Ensures that cookies are included in CORS requests:  \n withCredentials: true,  \n },  \n }),  \n)  \n```\nPlease refer to the following documentation for more details:\n- [Integrate Authentication into Go](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/integrate-auth/go#test-your-application)\n- [Integrate Authentication"

Here's an example of how it might look in code:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Configuration, OAuth2Api } from \"@ory/client\"  \nimport { Request, Response } from \"express\"  \n  \nconst ory = new OAuth2Api(  \n new Configuration({  \n basePath: `https://${process.env.ORY_PROJECT_SLUG}.projects.oryapis.com`,  \n accessToken: process.env.ORY_API_KEY,  \n }),  \n)  \n  \nfunction authenticateUserCredentials(email: string, password: string): any {  \n // Example method to authenticate users and fetch them from the DB.  \n}  \n  \nexport async function handleLogin(request: Request, response: Response) {  \n const challenge = request.query.login_challenge.toString()  \n const { data: loginRequest } = await ory.getOAuth2LoginRequest({  \n loginChallenge: challenge.toString(),  \n })  \n  \n // ... rest of the code\n}\n```\n(Source: [Ory Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oauth2-oidc/custom-login-consent/flow#login-endpoint-code-example))\n\nWhen you mention \"config\", it refers to the configuration settings of your Ory project. If you don't have an Ory project yet, you would need to create one to have these settings. The configuration settings include various parameters that control how Ory behaves, including the URLs for the login and consent operations.\n\nIf you're interested in setting up an Ory project, you can follow the guides on the [Ory Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/) page."

      "question": "projection",
      "answer": "Projections in EventStoreDB are a powerful toolset that allows you to set up queries that react to events as they are written, filter, and transform data from one or more streams into new streams. They are often used to transform lower-level events to higher-level, coarse-grain events. The resulting streams can be used in other projections, creating a real-time pipeline capability for processing events. This allows you to build sophisticated, event-driven systems with real-time data processing and analytics capabilities, without the need to directly modify source data [source](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/exploring-the-main-features-of-eventstoredb).\n\nProjections are particularly good at solving one specific query type, known as 'temporal correlation queries'. This query type is common in business systems and few can execute these queries well. It's important to note that projections require the event body to be in JSON [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v23.10/projections#introduction).\n\nYou can create a projection using the admin UI by opening the *Projections* tab, clicking the *New Projection* button, and filling in the details of your projection. Alternatively, you can also create projections programmatically [source](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/playing-with-projections#writing-your-projection).\n\nHere is an example of a projection code:\n```javascript\nfromAll()\n.when({\n    $init: function(){\n        return {\n            count: 0\n        }\n    },\n    ItemAdded: function(s,e){\n        if(e.body.Description.indexOf(\"Xbox One S\") >= 0){\n            s.count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\nThis projection counts the number of 'XBox One S's that customers added to their shopping carts [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/http-api/v23.10/projections#creating-your-first-projection)."

      "answer": "To customize the primary color in NextUI, you need to modify your `tailwind.config.js` file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst {nextui} = require(\"@nextui-org/react\");\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    nextui({\n      themes: {\n        dark: {\n          colors: {\n            primary: {\n              DEFAULT: \"#BEF264\",\n              foreground: \"#000000\",\n            },\n            focus: \"#BEF264\",\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nIn the above code, the primary color for the dark theme is set to `#BEF264` and the foreground color is set to `#000000`. You can replace these values with your desired colors.\n\nThis modification will impact all components using the `primary` color. For instance, the Button component uses the `primary` color as background color when the variant is `solid` or `ghost`.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Button} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n      <Button color=\"primary\" variant=\"solid\">Solid</Button>\n      <Button color=\"primary\" variant=\"ghost\">Ghost</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFor more details about the available semantic colors and color tokens, you can refer to the [Colors](https://nextui.org/docs/customization/colors) section in the NextUI documentation.\n\n[Source](https://nextui.org/docs/customization/customize-theme#customizing-colors)"

      "question": "how to deploy react app manually",
      "answer": "To manually deploy a React app on Netlify, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure you have the latest version of Netlify CLI installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install netlify-cli -g\n```\n\n2. Navigate to the directory of your project and initialize a new Netlify site by running:\n\n```bash\nnetlify init\n```\n\nIf you haven't initialized a Git repository, the CLI will prompt you to connect your local directory to GitHub. Follow the steps in your terminal to link your local directory with a remote repo to use continuous deployment for your site.\n\n3. Follow the prompts to create your site, select a team if necessary, and optionally create a site name. If you already initialized a Git repository, you can authorize your Git provider and set your build command and directory.\n\n4. To manually deploy your site, run the following command from your project directory:\n\n```bash\nnetlify deploy\n```\n\nThe first time you run the command, Netlify CLI will prompt you to select an existing site or create a new one, linking the site for all future deploys.\n\n5. The `deploy` command needs to know which folder to publish. If your project includes serverless functions, it needs to know the location of the functions folder as well. You can specify these using command flags like so:\n\n```bash\nnetlify deploy --dir=_site --functions=functions\n```\n\nIn this case, `_site` is the directory to be published and `functions` is the directory containing your serverless functions. Both paths are relative to the current directory.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documentation:\n\n- [Deploy your Create React App project with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/react#deploy-your-create-react-app-project-with-netlify-cli)\n- [Manual deploys with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started#manual-deploys)"

      "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with the Alpaca API. There could be a few reasons why you're experiencing this issue.\n\nFirstly, the Alpaca API is sensitive to the formatting of the dates. They must be in ISO format otherwise the API ignores them. The API doesn’t fail or cause an error if the dates aren’t recognized. Rather, the default date values are used. This could be why you're seeing data for today instead of the date range you specified. Make sure your dates are in the correct format. For example, `2020-01-05T09:30:00-04:00` is a correctly formatted date ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/3767)).\n\nSecondly, there was a reported issue where the API was not correctly handling timezones with a positive offset. If you're using a timezone with a positive offset, this could be causing your issue ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/3767)).\n\nLastly, there have been reports of missing bars in the minute bars API. It's possible that the data you're looking for is simply not available ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/12417)).\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I would recommend reaching out to Alpaca support for further assistance."

      "answer": "To implement a filter with an \"Enter\" event, you can use the `useTable` or `useSimpleList` hooks provided by Refine. These hooks have a `setFilters` function that you can use to change the filter state. You can call this function when the \"Enter\" event is triggered.\n\nHere is an example using the `useSimpleList` hook with Ant Design's `Input.Search` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useSimpleList } from \"@refinedev/antd\";  \nimport { Typography, List, Input } from \"antd\";  \n  \nconst { Text } = Typography;  \n  \ninterface IProduct {  \n id: number;  \n name: string;  \n description: string;  \n price: string;  \n}  \n  \nconst ProductList: React.FC = () => {  \n const { listProps, setFilters } = useSimpleList<IProduct>({  \n filters: {  \n initial: [  \n {  \n field: \"name\",  \n operator: \"contains\",  \n value: \"Awesome\",  \n },  \n ],  \n },  \n });  \n  \n return (  \n <div>  \n <Input.Search  \n placeholder=\"Search by name\"  \n onChange={(e) => {  \n setFilters([  \n {  \n field: \"name\",  \n operator: \"contains\",  \n value: e.target.value,  \n },  \n ]);  \n }}  \n />  \n <List {...listProps} renderItem={renderItem} />  \n </div>  \n );  \n};  \n  \nconst renderItem = (item: IProduct) => {  \n const { id, name, description, price } = item;  \n  \n return (  \n <List.Item actions={[<Text key={id}>{price}</Text>]}>  \n <List.Item.Meta title={name} description={description} />  \n </List.Item>  \n );  \n};  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `setFilters` function is called whenever the value of the `Input.Search` component changes. If you want to call the function only when the \"Enter\" key is pressed, you can use the `onPressEnter` prop instead of `onChange`.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-simple-list#filtering)."

According to the [Sonatype Nexus Repository System Requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-nexus-repository-system-requirements.html), any fully compatible S3 implementation that supports the AWS SDK version 1.12.299 can be used as a blob store. However, it's important to note that performance characteristics may differ from AWS S3, so it's recommended to work with your vendor to ensure sufficient performance for your desired workload. \n\nWhen configuring the blob store, you can provide either the existing or desired AWS S3 bucket name. Nexus Repository automatically creates an S3 bucket when you create a blob store if one does not already exist. However, you may also create the bucket yourself. The AWS user for accessing the S3 Blobstore bucket needs to be granted permission for several actions on the S3 bucket resource, including s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject, s3:DeleteObject, and more. \n\nFor Nexus Repository to create and delete buckets automatically, an IAM policy associated with the Nexus Repository user must include the s3:DeleteBucket permission. \n\nPlease refer to the [Configuring Blob Stores](https://help.sonatype.com/en/configuring-blob-stores.html) section for more details."

This may be useful if, for example, you want to use data elements with option sets from multiple program stages within the same program in order to filter out the number of enrollments in calculating your indicator.\n\nAfter selecting the analytics type, you will see “Analytics period boundaries.” Leave these all as default.\n\nNext, select the expression tab in order to edit the expression. This is where you define what you want to happen mathematically. In this case, you can use a simple variable, called enrollment count, to define your expression. You are no longer counting events, but enrollments, as you want to combine information across the enrollment and then evaluate it using your filter.\n\nOnce you have created the program indicator, it is a good idea to test if it is functional. You can compare the properly configured indicator with the one you have created to ensure that the value is correct. In order to do this you can navigate to the pivot table app.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to the [DHIS2 documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/training-docs/tracker-configuration-academy/program-indicators/learneraposs-guide-to-program-indicators.html#add-a-new-indicator-and-edit-the-program-indicator-details)."

      "question": "What is Apache SkyWalking?",
      "answer": "Apache SkyWalking is an open-source observability platform and application performance management (APM) system. It is designed specifically for microservices, cloud-native architectures, and container-based (Docker, K8s, Nesos) architectures. SkyWalking provides a unified, efficient, and customizable observability analysis platform solution. It offers distributed tracing, service mesh telemetry analysis, metric aggregation, and visualization as an integrated solution. \n\nSkyWalking is a top-level project under the Apache Software Foundation that graduated from the Apache incubator in 2019. It is designed to work with microservices architectures and dominant cloud-native environments in today's industry and is actively seeking to integrate with state-of-the-art technologies, including service mesh, eBPF, and AIOps. SkyWalking provides end-to-end tracing, metrics, logging analysis, and service topology visualization, allowing developers to identify performance issues and optimize their application's resources.\n\nSkyWalking is not limited to the idea of multi-language probes in the past, it faces multiple data sources, and can provide a unified, efficient, and customizable observability analysis platform solution. The Observability Analysis Platform (OAP) is a new concept proposed by the SkyWalking community PMC team. OAP divides observability into two dimensions and three levels: Tracing trace link data and Metrics metric data. The three levels are Receiver, Analysis Core, and Query Core.\n\nSkyWalking is also the first and only personal open source project in China that has developed into a top-level Apache project. It provides functional features that have only been offered by commercial APM or monitoring companies in the past. It is now widely used and backed up by a great many R&D as well as operation and maintenance teams.\n\nSources:\n- [Apache SkyWalking in Action](https://tetrate.io/resource/apache-skywalking-in-action/)\n- [Apache SkyWalking Introduction](https://skywalking-handbook.netlify.app/tracing_system/skywalking/skywalking_intro#apache-skywalking-%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D)\n- [Apache SkyWalking Discussion](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions/10586)"

      "question": "what is concurency?",
      "answer": "In the context of RunPod, concurrency refers to the ability of a single worker to manage multiple tasks at the same time through non-blocking operations. This is achieved by supporting asynchronous functions for request handling. The level of concurrency is contingent upon the runtime's capacity and the resources at its disposal. This capability allows for efficient task switching and resource utilization, enabling the worker to process multiple requests simultaneously.\n\nIn RunPod, you can dynamically adjust a worker's concurrency level using the `concurrency_modifier` configuration option within `runpod.serverless.start`. This adjustment enables the optimization of resource consumption and performance by regulating the number of tasks a worker can handle concurrently.\n\nHere is an example of how you can set up the `concurrency_modifier` function:\n\n```python\ndef adjust_concurrency(current_concurrency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Dynamically adjusts the concurrency level based on the observed request rate.\n    \"\"\"\n    global request_rate\n    update_request_rate()  # Placeholder for request rate updates\n    max_concurrency = 10  # Maximum allowable concurrency\n    min_concurrency = 1  # Minimum concurrency to maintain\n    high_request_rate_threshold = 50  # Threshold for high request volume\n\n    # Increase concurrency if under max limit and request rate is high\n    if (request_rate > high_request_rate_threshold and current_concurrency < max_concurrency):\n        return current_concurrency + 1\n\n    # Decrease concurrency if above min limit and request rate is low\n    elif (request_rate <= high_request_rate_threshold and current_concurrency > min_concurrency):\n        return current_concurrency - 1\n\n    return current_concurrency\n```\n\nYou can then start the serverless function with the defined handler and `concurrency_modifier` to enable dynamic concurrency adjustment:\n\n```python\nrunpod.serverless.start(\n    {\n        \"handler\": process_request,\n        \"concurrency_modifier\": adjust_concurrency,\n    }\n)\n```\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [RunPod documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/workers/handlers/handler-concurrency#configure-concurrency-modifier)."

      "question": "fetch vs unstable_cache\nDoes fetch behave the same way as unstable cache?",
      "answer": "No, `fetch` and `unstable_cache` in Next.js do not behave the same way.\n\n`fetch` is a built-in function in JavaScript used for making HTTP requests. In the context of Next.js, it can be used for client-side data fetching. When used at the page level, the data is fetched at runtime, and the content of the page is updated as the data changes. When used at the component level, the data is fetched at the time of the component mount, and the content of the component is updated as the data changes. However, using client-side data fetching with `fetch` can affect the performance of your application and the load speed of your pages because the data fetching is done at the time of the component or pages mount, and the data is not cached [[source](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side)].\n\nOn the other hand, `unstable_cache` is a function provided by Next.js that allows you to cache the results of expensive operations, like database queries, and reuse them across multiple requests. It returns a function that when invoked, returns a Promise that resolves to the cached data. If the data is not in the cache, the provided function will be invoked, and its result will be cached and returned [[source](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache#returns)]. However, it's important to note that this API is unstable and may change in the future.\n\nIn summary, while both `fetch` and `unstable_cache` can be used for data fetching in Next.js, they serve different purposes and have different behaviors. `fetch` is used for making HTTP requests and does not cache data, while `unstable_cache` is used for caching the results of expensive operations to improve performance."

You can find more information about this in the [Mapbox documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/search/guides/search-by-coordinate#search-by-coordinate).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Tilequery API, which allows you to pass a geographic point and it will return features that are near that point for any tileset, and include a distance value in the response. If the distance to a polygon is 0, it means the point lies within the polygon. You can find more information about this in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77422179).\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the Tilequery API:\n\n```javascript\nhttps://api.mapbox.com/v4/examples.4ze9z6tv/tilequery/-77.033835,38.89975.json?access_token=YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `-77.033835,38.89975` with your geographic coordinates and `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your Mapbox access token.

      "answer": "The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `transactionId` must be set or a `client` must be provided with `freezeWith`. This is part of the process of creating a transaction in Hedera.\n\nWhen creating a transaction, you first create an instance of the transaction you want to perform. In this case, it's an `AccountUpdateTransaction`. You then set the necessary parameters for the transaction, such as the `accountId` and `key`.\n\nAfter setting the parameters, you need to freeze the transaction for signing. This is done using the `freezeWith(client)` method, where `client` is your Hedera client. This step is necessary before you can sign the transaction.\n\nHere's an example of how to do this in JavaScript, based on the knowledge sources:\n\n```javascript\nconst transaction = await new AccountUpdateTransaction()\n  .setAccountId(accountId)\n  .setKey(key)\n  .freezeWith(client);\n```\n\nIn this example, `accountId` is the ID of the account you want to update, `key` is the new key for the account, and `client` is your Hedera client.\n\nIf you're still seeing the error after ensuring you've correctly used `freezeWith(client)`, it's possible that your `client` is not correctly set up or that you're not correctly passing it to `freezeWith(client)`.\n\nSources:\n- [Manually sign a transaction Part 2](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/deprecated/sdks/transactions/manually-sign-a-transaction)\n- [Update an account](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/accounts-and-hbar/update-an-account)"

      "answer": "Zephyr's SysBuild and NCS's \"child-image\" support are related but serve different purposes. \n\nSysBuild is a higher-level build system used to combine multiple other build systems together. It can be used to build a Zephyr application together with the MCUboot bootloader, flash them both onto your device, and debug the results. SysBuild works by configuring and building at least a Zephyr application and, optionally, as many additional projects as you want. The additional projects can be either Zephyr applications or other types of builds you want to run. SysBuild is written in CMake and uses Kconfig ([source](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/zephyr/build/sysbuild/index.html#sysbuild)).\n\nOn the other hand, \"child-image\" support in NCS refers to the way build systems handle child images. While the default CMake build system nests child images in a gradually more layered hierarchy, SysBuild lists the child images in a flatter hierarchical structure, making it easier to work with applications that use several images ([source](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/guides/build_overview.html#build-system-support-overview)).\n\nSo, while both SysBuild and \"child-image\" support are related to the build process, they serve different purposes.

      "answer": "The issue you're experiencing might be related to the database migration process. Nexus Repository Pro supports migration from OrientDB to either H2 or PostgreSQL databases. During this migration, configuration and component metadata are moved from OrientDB to the new database, but not vice versa. The migration process is non-destructive, meaning the OrientDB still exists as a restoration point until you delete it [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/migrating-to-a-new-database.html)].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all formats are supported in the new databases. As of Nexus Repository 3.34.0, support was added for RubyGems (among other formats) for those using H2 or PostgreSQL databases [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/nexus-repository-3-34-0---3-34-1-release-notes.html)]. \n\nIf you're experiencing issues during startup after migration, it could be due to a number of factors. It's recommended to check the health of your OrientDB database before migration, as any existing corruption could affect the migration process [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/nexus-repository-3-36-0-release-notes.html)]. \n\nAdditionally, Nexus Repository will stop during startup if it determines that the database version is newer than the Nexus Repository version. This is a safety measure to prevent data or table structure changes that Nexus Repository cannot interpret [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/nexus-repository-3-36-0-release-notes.html)].\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, it might be necessary to revert back to OrientDB following the steps provided in the documentation [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/migrating-to-a-new-database.html)]. \n\nFor further assistance, consider reaching out to Sonatype support or referring to their detailed documentation."

      "answer": "Based on the provided knowledge sources, it doesn't appear that you can directly change the URL for the settings flow when starting a recovery flow through the admin API. The settings flow URL is likely configured in the Ory Kratos system itself and not directly manipulatable through the API.\n\nHowever, during the recovery flow, the user is redirected through the settings flow and eventually to a `return_to` URL. This `return_to` URL persists across flows only when a recovery flow transitions into the settings flow. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Create a recovery flow with `return_to`.\n2. An email is sent with a `link` or `code` method.\n3. The user completes the recovery flow by submitting the `code` or clicking the `link`.\n4. The user gets a session and is redirected through the `settings` flow.\n5. The user submits the `settings` flow with an updated password.\n6. The user is redirected to the `return_to` URL.\n\nThis process is described in the [Ory documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/bring-your-own-ui/custom-ui-advanced-integration#advanced-redirects).\n\nIf you want to change where the user ends up after the settings flow, you might be able to manipulate the `return_to` URL.

The video host you use must be supported by VRChat. A full list of supported hosts is available at [Video Player Allowlist](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/video-players/www-whitelist). Some recommended hosts include YouTube and Vimeo Basic, which are free, or you can use your own host, which is usually a paid service. If you use your own host outside of the allowlist, users must have the \"Allow Untrusted URLs\" option enabled in their Settings to see your content. \n\nSecondly, VRChat on Quest can only play videos from direct links to video files. These URLs typically end with a filename ending in a supported video type like .mp4 or .webm. If you visit the link and see a whole website around a video, that link will probably not play on Android / Quest because the application that VRChat uses to resolve these links into videos does not run on Android. Creators will need to move the video to a host that supports direct links, or find another way to work around this issue.\n\nLastly, if a service is not on the allowlist, it will not play unless \"Allow Untrusted URLs\" is checked in Settings. VRChat on Android will not play video if the host is not using HTTPS protocol.\n\nPlease refer to the [Creator Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/video-players#supported-video-hosts) for more details."

The build hook name is for your reference, and will display in your list of build hooks, as well as in the default deploy message for each deploy triggered by the hook. You can select a branch to build by default, but only branches which have been deployed at least once will appear in this list.\n\nOnce you save your build hook settings, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL for that build hook. To trigger this hook, you need to send a POST request to that URL. This POST request can be sent from a service you want to integrate with Netlify, or you can send these requests yourself. For example, you can run a curl command from your terminal:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d '{}' https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/5c23354f454e1350f8543e78\n```\n\nYou can also test build hook requests with tools like Postman.

You can then view the state of this projection to see the count of events in the stream.\n\nPlease note that this projection needs to be enabled and you can check it from the Web UI. If projections are not enabled, you might not be able to run queries as they are run through projections.\n\nFor more information on creating and managing projections, you can refer to the [EventStoreDB documentation](http://docs.geteventstore.com/projections/4.0.0/user-defined-projections/).\n\nPlease note that this will give you the count of events in a specific stream, not the count of streams with a specific name. If you want to count the number of streams with a specific name, you might need to create a naming convention that allows you to categorize your streams and then use a projection to count the number of streams in a category.\n\nRemember that EventStoreDB is designed to handle many millions of streams, so it's perfectly fine to have a large number of streams in your system."

If you already have a Next.js project, you can install NextUI using npm. You also need to setup Tailwind CSS as NextUI is built on top of it. Here is the code to install NextUI and setup Tailwind CSS:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app -e https://github.com/nextui-org/next-pages-template\nnpm i @nextui-org/react framer-motion\n```\n\nAnd the Tailwind CSS setup:\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nimport {nextui} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nconst config = { \n  content: [\n    // ... \n    \"./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\" \n  ], \n  theme: { extend: {}, }, \n  darkMode: \"class\", \n  plugins: [nextui()]\n}\nexport default config;\n```\n\n2. **Use the `useAsyncList` and `useInfiniteScroll` hooks**: NextUI supports infinite pagination through these hooks. You can use the `useAsyncList` hook from `@react-stately/data` and `@nextui-org/use-infinite-scroll` hook. You can install the `use-infinite-scroll` hook using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @nextui-org/use-infinite-scroll\n```\n\nAnd then import it in your component:\n\n```javascript\nimport {useInfiniteScroll} from \"@nextui-org/use-infinite-scroll\";\n```\n\n3. **Implement the infinite pagination**: Unfortunately, the exact implementation of infinite pagination in a `div.grid` is not provided in the knowledge sources. However, you can refer to the [Infinite Pagination](https://nextui.org/docs/components/table#infinite-pagination) section in the NextUI documentation for a general idea of how to implement it.

      "question": "cannot be converted from 'String' to 'StringLiteral'",
      "answer": "In Modular's Mojo language, `String` and `StringLiteral` are different types. A `StringLiteral` represents a string literal, while `String` is a more general string type. \n\nThe `StringLiteral` type has several methods, such as `__str__` which converts the string literal to a string, and `__init__` which creates a string literal from a builtin string type. However, there is no built-in method to convert a `String` to a `StringLiteral`.\n\nHere are some of the methods of `StringLiteral`:\n\n```python\n__init__(value: string) -> Self\n__str__(self: Self) -> String\n__bool__(self: Self) -> Bool\n__eq__(self: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool\n__ne__(self: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool\n__contains__(self: Self, substr: Self) -> Bool\n__add__(self: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self\n__len__(self: Self) -> Int\n```\n\nIf you want to convert a `String` to a `StringLiteral`, you might need to create a new `StringLiteral` using the `__init__` method and pass the `String` as the argument. However, this might not work if the `String` is not a literal string. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Modular documentation on StringLiteral](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal)."

Open your code editor and locate the `<form>` HTML element in your file. \n\n3. Add the attribute `data-netlify=\"true\"` to the form element. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```html\n<form\n class=\"form\"\n method=\"POST\"\n name=\"contact\"\n action=\"/success\"\n data-netlify=\"true\"\n>\n```\n\n4. Commit and push these changes to GitHub.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -am \"add a form\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n5. Once the production build finishes, visit your site and navigate to the page about Netlify Forms, `YOUR_URL/netlify-forms/`.\n\n6. Fill in some details and select **Send**. You should find a success message indicating that the form entry submitted successfully.\n\n7. In the Netlify UI, select the **Forms** tab for your site.\n\n8. Select the active **contact** form from the **Active forms** list, and you should find the submission listed.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started#set-up-netlify-forms).\n\nIf you're using a static site generator like Hugo, you'll need to add the form to the `index.html` file on your site. The form will need to include either `data-netlify=\"true\"` or `netlify` attribute in the form tag. If you have multiple forms, each form will need a different `name` attribute within the form tag. You can find more information on this in the [Netlify forum post](https://answers.netlify.com/t/84261).\n\nIf you're using JavaScript to render a form client-side, you can create a hidden HTML form with the `data-netlify=\"true\"` attribute or a `netlify` attribute and input fields with `name` attributes to match the inputs of your JavaScript-rendered form.

In Webiny, each project application is deployed separately using the `yarn webiny deploy` command followed by the name of the application and the environment parameter (`--env`). \n\nFor example, to deploy only the **Core**, **API**, and **Admin** applications, you would run the following commands:\n\n```bash\nyarn webiny deploy core --env dev\nyarn webiny deploy api --env dev\nyarn webiny deploy admin --env dev\n```\n\nBy not running the `yarn webiny deploy website --env dev` command, the **Website** application will not be deployed.\n\nRemember that the **Website** and **Admin** applications depend on the **API** application, and the **API** application depends on the **Core** application. So, when deploying the applications, make sure to deploy them in the correct order: **Core**, **API**, and then **Admin**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Webiny documentation on project deployment](https://www.webiny.com/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment)."

      "answer": "If your FusionAuth upgrade is unsuccessful or causes unexpected issues, you may need to roll back your FusionAuth instance to a previous version. Here are the steps for initiating a rollback:\n\n1. Stop your FusionAuth instances.\n2. Initiate the process to restore from the database backup taken prior to starting the upgrade.\n3. Redeploy FusionAuth using your previous version. How you do this will depend on your deployment method.\n\nIf you are running a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, you can find instructions for rolling back an upgrade [here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud#rolling-back-from-a-problematic-upgrade).\n\nIt’s important to consider the timing implications of a rollback or any disaster recovery process. RTO, or Recovery Time Objective, is the targeted period time within which a service should be restored after an outage to avoid unacceptable consequences. RPO, or Recovery Point Objective, on the other hand, refers to the maximum tolerable amount of data loss measured in time. In the context of a FusionAuth upgrade rollback, the RPO would be the time since the last backup before the upgrade, and the RTO would be the time it takes to stand up the older version of the system and restore the database.\n\nPlease note that FusionAuth does not support downgrades in an automated fashion. If you want to downgrade, you have two options:\n\n1. Restore from a backup. You should, in general, take a database backup before you do any upgrades, so you could roll back using that.\n2. Script it. This would be standing up a previous instance, then porting over all the users, applications and other configuration from the current instance. You'd have to modify a few things in transit (as objects have changed).\n\nFor FusionAuth Cloud customers with Business and High Availability deployments with backups, rollbacks are now supported. Please see the FusionAuth Cloud documentation for more information: [Rolling Back From a Problematic Upgrade](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/cloud#rolling-back-from-a-problematic-upgrade).\n\nSources:\n- [Rolling Back an Upgrade](https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/deploy/upgrade#rolling-back-an-upgrade)\n- [Forum Topic: How can I downgrade an instance](https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/1117/how-can-i-downgrade-an-instance)"

Ensure you have already installed the latest JDK from Oracle on the target system and the system meets the [system requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXIQ/System+Requirements).\n2. Download and extract the [clm-jsw.zip](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/article_attachments/360085167814) file into a directory path that does not contain spaces.\n3. Replace the extracted conf/config.yml with the config.yml file from current Nexus IQ server installation (be sure to check the \"sonatypeWork\" property in the copied version to make sure it is correct).\n4. Copy the nexus-iq-server-<version>.jar file from your installation into the \"lib\" directory. There should only be one jar file - the IQ server versioned jar file you intend to start the server with - in the lib directory at any given time. Do not copy the nexus-iq-cli-<version>.jar file into the lib directory. That is the command line scanner, and it cannot be on the class path of IQ Server. Do not leave any old nexus-iq-server-<version>.jar file in the lib directory. This will cause class conflicts and may damage your instance.\n5. The service will run as the SYSTEM user. IQ server requires use of a temporary directory to perform some work. The SYSTEM user will use \"%systemroot%\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\Temp\" as its temporary directory. On some versions of Windows this directory does not exist by default. Make sure that this directory exists. Create it manually if it does not.\n6. Using an administrative user, run \".\\bin\\clm install\".\n7. Using an administrative user, run \".\\bin\\clm start\" to start the windows service, or start it through the services UI.\n8. Verify that on restarting the host, that the application will successfully restart itself.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [source](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/213463798-Running-the-Nexus-IQ-Server-as-a-Service-on-Windows#01G6N9TDWPTMFX0DYTTCTPTR67)."

Silicon Labs provides a range of solutions catering to different wireless protocols like Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and others.\n\nIf your project requires short-range communication, typically in a personal area network, Bluetooth LE provided by Silicon Labs could be a good choice. It's power-efficient and widely used in applications like wearables, health monitors, etc. You can get started with Bluetooth LE development using the Simplicity Studio Development environment provided by Silicon Labs. It includes everything needed for IoT product development with Silicon Labs devices including a resource and project launcher, software configuration tools, full IDE with GNU toolchain, and analysis tools. [source](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-getting-started-overview)\n\nFor applications that require creating mesh networks with low power consumption, Zigbee could be a suitable protocol. Silicon Labs provides the EmberZNet SDK for Zigbee development. [source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1133-dynamic-multiprotocol-bluetooth-zigbee.pdf)\n\nIf your IoT project involves cloud connectivity, you might want to consider MQTT protocol.

Path Issue in Dev Mode: There is another [Github issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/1211) that discusses a similar problem with `Astro.resolve()`. The issue suggests that the resolver runs relative to the page and not the component, which might be causing your issue. However, this issue is also not resolved yet. As a workaround, you might need to use absolute paths instead of relative paths, or adjust your project structure to avoid the need for `../` in the path.\n\nPlease note that these are potential solutions based on the provided knowledge sources and might not work in your specific case. If you continue to experience issues, I would recommend raising an issue in the Astro Github repository or asking for help in the Astro community."

      "question": "hello, i want to add pins on a map and attach images to them, how can I do?",
      "answer": "Sure, you can add pins (markers) to a map and attach images to them using Mapbox. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Load your data**: You need to have your data ready, which includes the coordinates of the locations where you want to place the markers.\n\n2. **Create an HTML DOM element for each marker**: You can do this using the Mapbox GL JS `Marker` method. This method attaches an empty `div` to each point in your GeoJSON data. You'll need to specify the style of the marker before adding it to the map. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```javascript\n// create a HTML element for each feature\nconst el = document.createElement('div');\nel.className = 'marker';\n\n// make a marker for each feature and add to the map\nnew mapboxgl.Marker(el).setLngLat(feature.geometry.coordinates).addTo(map);\n```\n\n3. **Style your markers**: You can style your markers using CSS. For example, you can add an image file as the `background-image` for a class called `marker`. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```css\n.marker {\n  background-image: url('mapbox-icon.png');\n  background-size: cover;\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n```\n\n4. **Add markers to the map**: After creating and styling your markers, you can add them to the map. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```javascript\n// add markers to map\nfor (const feature of geojson.features) {\n  // create a HTML element for each feature\n  const el = document.createElement('div');\n  el.className = 'marker';\n\n  // make a marker for each feature and add to the map\n  new mapboxgl.Marker(el).setLngLat(feature.geometry.coordinates).addTo(map);\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that these markers are added to the map as HTML elements, and they are styled using the CSS you wrote in the last step. This approach works well for cases in which you do not need to change the marker's style at runtime.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Add custom markers in Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/custom-markers-gl-js#add-html-markers) tutorial.\n\nSources:\n- [Add custom markers in Mapbox GL JS > Add HTML markers](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/custom-markers-gl-js#add-html-markers)\n- [Add custom markers in Mapbox GL JS > Add markers to the map](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/custom-markers-gl-js#add-markers-to-the-map)"

      "answer": "In the context of Humanitec and its use of Terraform, resources are destroyed when the Orchestrator Resource is deprovisioned according to the lifecycle of the resource. It's important to note that simply removing a resource dependency is not sufficient for the resource to be deprovisioned. This is designed to allow for rollbacks without losing data in stateful resources. The destruction of resources is triggered by the command `terraform destroy`.\n\nFor example, in the cleanup process of a tutorial, you might use the `terraform destroy -auto-approve` command to destroy the setup. This command is executed in the `terraform` directory.\n\n```bash\ncd ../terraform && terraform destroy -auto-approve\n```\n\nIn another scenario, when cleaning up after provisioning a Redis cluster on AWS using Terraform, you would delete the production environment of your demo application. This action also triggers the deletion of the AWS Elasticache instance created for this environment and the Kubernetes objects deployed for the workload onto the EKS cluster.\n\n```bash\nhumctl delete env production --org $HUMANITEC_ORG --app $APP_ID --token $HUMANITEC_TOKEN\n```\n\nYou can find more details in the following sources:\n- [When does the driver destroy resources?](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform#when-does-the-driver-destroy-resources)\n- [Cleaning up after updating Resource Definitions for related Applications](https://developer.humanitec.com/training/master-your-internal-developer-platform/update-resource-definitions-for-related-applications#cleaning-up)\n- [Cleaning up after provisioning a Redis cluster on AWS using Terraform](https://developer.humanitec.com/training/master-your-internal-developer-platform/provision-redis-aws#cleaning-up)"

      "question": "What consensus protocol does Cockroach use?",
      "answer": "CockroachDB uses the Raft consensus protocol. This protocol ensures that your data is safely stored on multiple nodes and that those nodes agree on the current state even if some of them are temporarily disconnected. The Raft protocol is employed when a range receives a write, a quorum of nodes containing replicas of the range acknowledge the write. This means your data is safely stored and a majority of nodes agree on the database's current state, even if some of the nodes are offline. When a write does not achieve consensus, forward progress halts to maintain consistency within the cluster.\n\nIn terms of executing transactions, the Raft leader receives proposed Raft commands from the leaseholder. Each Raft command is a write that is used to represent an atomic state change of the underlying key-value pairs stored in the storage engine. For each command the Raft leader receives, it proposes a vote to the other members of the Raft group. Once the command achieves consensus (i.e., a majority of nodes including itself acknowledge the Raft command), it is committed to the Raft leader’s Raft log and written to the storage engine. At the same time, the Raft leader also sends a command to all other nodes to include the command in their Raft logs.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to these sources: [source 1](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview#raft-protocol), [source 2](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview#consensus), [source 3](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction#raft-leader), [source 4](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/glossary#raft-protocol), [source 5](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/reads-and-writes-overview#raft-protocol), [source 6](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/thank-you/?pdf=/pdf/the-definitive-guide-to-cockroachdb-oreilly.pdf), [source 7](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/glossary)."

      "answer": "CosmWasm contracts and IBC contracts are not inherently different types of contracts, but rather, they are used in different contexts within the Osmosis ecosystem.\n\nCosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. It allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust and execute them in a WebAssembly (Wasm) virtual machine. The CosmWasm contracts in Osmosis are used to handle various functionalities such as cross-chain swaps and rate limiting. For example, the `MsgExecuteContract` is a CosmWasm contract that is used to initiate contract calls, especially for cross-chain transactions. It includes fields like `Sender`, `Contract`, `Msg`, and `Funds` to facilitate these transactions [[source](https://docs.osmosis.zone/overview/features/ibc-hooks#wasm-hooks)].\n\nOn the other hand, IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) is a protocol for secure and reliable communication between heterogeneous blockchains. In the context of Osmosis, IBC contracts (or IBC hooks) are used as middleware to parse ICS20 transfers and initiate Wasm contract calls if certain conditions are met. These hooks are particularly useful for cross-chain swaps and other cross-chain contract calls that involve token movement [[source](https://docs.osmosis.zone/osmosis-core/modules/ibc-hooks#wasm-hooks)].\n\nIn summary, while both CosmWasm contracts and IBC contracts are used in the Osmosis ecosystem, they serve different purposes.

      "answer": "In FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language), you can write a for loop using the following syntax: `for i in 1..n return i`. This expression will iterate `n` times, similar to a loop-cardinality.\n\nFor example, if you need to iterate over a collection in a multi-instance activity in Camunda, you can define an `inputCollection` expression that specifies the collection to iterate over. To access the current element of the `inputCollection` value within the instance, the multi-instance activity can define the `inputElement` variable.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use a for loop in FEEL:\n\n```feel\nfor i in 1..n return i\n```\n\nIn this example, `i` is the loop variable, `1..n` defines the range of the loop, and `return i` specifies what to return for each iteration of the loop.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Camunda documentation on FEEL control flow](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-control-flow/#for-loops)."

To mint 100.55 tokens, one must provide an amount of 10055.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `TokenMintTransaction` in Java:\n\n```java\n//Mint another 1,000 tokens\nTokenMintTransaction transaction = new TokenMintTransaction()\n .setTokenId(tokenId)\n .setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(20)) //Use when HBAR is under 10 cents\n .setAmount(1000);\n\n//Freeze the unsigned transaction, sign with the supply private key of the token, submit the transaction to a Hedera network\nTransactionResponse txResponse = transaction\n .freezeWith(client)\n .sign(supplyKey)\n .execute(client);\n\n//Request the receipt of the transaction\nTransactionReceipt receipt = txResponse.getReceipt(client);\n\n//Obtain the transaction consensus status\nStatus transactionStatus = receipt.status;\n\nSystem.out.println(\"The transaction consensus status is \" +transactionStatus;\n```\n\nAnd here is how to use it in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n//Mint another 1,000 tokens and freeze the unsigned transaction for manual signing\nconst transaction = await new TokenMintTransaction()\n .setTokenId(tokenId)\n .setAmount(1000)\n .setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(20)) //Use when HBAR is under 10 cents\n .freezeWith(client);\n\n//Sign with the supply private key of the token \nconst signTx = await transaction.sign(supplyKey);\n\n//Submit the transaction to a Hedera network  \nconst txResponse = await signTx.execute(client);\n\n//Request the receipt of the transaction\nconst receipt = await txResponse.getReceipt(client);\n\n//Get the transaction consensus status\nconst transactionStatus = receipt.status;\n\nconsole.log(\"The transaction consensus status \" +transactionStatus.toString());\n```\n\nPlease note that the `TokenMintTransaction` requires the supply key to sign the transaction. If no Supply Key is defined, the transaction will resolve to `TOKEN_HAS_NO_SUPPLY_KEY`.\n\nSources:\n- [Hedera Docs: Mint a Token](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/deprecated/sdks/token-service/mint-a-token)\n- [Hedera Docs: TokenMint](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/hedera-api/readme-1/tokenmint)\n- [Hedera Blog: Get Started with the Hedera Token Service](https://hedera.com/blog/get-started-with-the-hedera-token-service-part-2)"

      "question": "How to invalidate/delete sessions for CredentialsProvider?\nI just deleted the database but the session cookies existing on the client side let the user access the page even though they're deleted on the database. How do i tackle this?",
      "answer": "In Next.js, you can invalidate or delete sessions in a couple of ways. If you're using cookie-based sessions, you can delete the cookies directly. This can be done in a Server Action or Route Handler using the `cookies().delete(name)` or `cookies().set(name, '')` functions. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function delete(data) {\n cookies().delete('name')\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set a new cookie with the same name and an empty value:\n\n```javascript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function delete(data) {\n cookies().set('name', '')\n}\n```\n\nOr, you can set `maxAge` to 0 to immediately expire a cookie:\n\n```javascript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function delete(data) {\n cookies().set('name', 'value', { maxAge: 0 })\n}\n```\n\nRemember, these actions should be performed in a Server Action or Route Handler. \n\nIf you're using a database session, you'll need to handle the deletion of session data from your database. This will depend on your specific database setup and is not directly handled by Next.js.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that even after deleting the session from the server-side (either cookie or database), the client-side may still have a stale state due to caching. You can invalidate the Router Cache in Next.js by revalidating data on-demand with `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag`, or by using `cookies.set` or `cookies.delete` which invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale. Another method is by calling `router.refresh` which will invalidate the Router Cache and make a new request to the server for the current route.\n\nSources:\n- [Deleting Cookies in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies#deleting-cookies)\n- [Invalidating Router Cache in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#invalidation-1)\n- [Selecting Session Management in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication#selecting-session-management-in-nextjs)"

This can be done by creating a custom tool and overriding the `_run` method. In the `_run` method, you can extract the action input prompt.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nclass CustomTool(BaseTool):\n    def _run(self, tool_input: str) -> str:\n        # Extract the action input prompt here\n        # Your code goes here\n```\n\nYou can then use this custom tool when initializing your agent:\n\n```python\ntools = [CustomTool()]\nagent = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=qa_agent, tools=tools, verbose=verbose, memory=memory)\nagent.run(input)\n```\n\nPlease note that the code above is a simplified example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following discussions on GitHub:\n- [Asking for user input as tool for agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/1438)\n- [Using agents with custom tools completely changes the input if question is asked in different language](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/4561)\n- [Issue: Reduced query in a agent tool _run method](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/9389)"

You can follow the quickstart guide provided by Clerk for more details ([Clerk Quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)).\n\nIn addition, to make authenticated requests to Convex during server rendering, you can pass a JWT token to `preloadQuery` or `fetchQuery` in the third options argument. Here's an example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { preloadQuery } from \"convex/nextjs\";  \nimport { api } from \"@/convex/_generated/api\";  \nimport { Tasks } from \"./Tasks\";  \n  \nexport async function TasksWrapper() {  \n const token = await getAuthToken();  \n const preloadedTasks = await preloadQuery(  \n api.tasks.list,  \n { list: \"default\" },  \n { token },  \n );  \n return <Tasks preloadedTasks={preloadedTasks} />;  \n}  \n```\n\nThe implementation of `getAuthToken` depends on your authentication provider.

However, if you're still seeing users associated with the deleted project, it might be due to some delay or issue.\n\nIf the users are still appearing on your 'active user' list, it's because all permissions and user details are inherited from your VCS (GitHub or Bitbucket). To remove a user from the CircleCI account, they must first be removed from the organization on your VCS. CircleCI is not able to remove users from your organization's active user list mid-billing cycle.

      "answer": "The error message you're encountering suggests that you're trying to set a default admin password while not using the internal authentication of EventStoreDB. \n\nEventStoreDB supports authentication based on usernames and passwords out of the box. It provides two default users, `$ops` and `$admin`. The ability to set default admin and ops passwords on the first run of the database has been added. This can be done by setting the `EVENTSTORE_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `EVENTSTORE_DEFAULT_OPS_PASSWORD` environment variables. However, these options can only be set through environment variables due to security reasons. If you try to pass the options using command line or config file, you will receive an error message.\n\nIf you're not using the internal authentication, you might be using an external authentication system.

      "answer": "Memgraph uses an on-disk transactional storage mode when the data size is larger than the available memory. In this mode, the disk is used as a physical storage which allows you to save more data than the capacity of your RAM. This helps keep the hardware costs to a minimum, but you should expect slower performance when compared to the in-memory transactional storage mode. \n\nWhile executing queries, all the graph objects used in the transactions still need to be able to fit in the RAM, or Memgraph will throw an exception. Memgraph uses RocksDB as a background storage to serialize nodes and relationships into a key-value format. The used architecture is also known as \"larger than memory\" as it enables in-memory databases to save more data than the main memory can hold, without the performance overhead caused by the buffer pool.\n\nThe imported data resides on the disk, while the main memory contains two caches, one executing operations on the main RocksDB instance and the other for operations that require indexes. In both cases, Memgraph's custom `SkipList` cache is used, which allows a multithreaded read-write access pattern.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Memgraph documentation on Storage Memory Usage](https://memgraph.com/docs/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage)."

      "answer": "The Medusa documentation does not explicitly mention the ability to sort by custom fields. The examples provided in the documentation show sorting by the `created_at` attribute for products. However, it's important to note that sorting is done based on the `order` field available on methods or hooks supporting pagination. \n\nHere are examples of how sorting is done in Medusa:\n\n- Using the Medusa JS Client:\n```javascript\nimport Medusa from \"@medusajs/medusa-js\"  \nconst medusa = new Medusa({  \n baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL,  \n maxRetries: 3,  \n})  \n// must be previously logged in or use api token  \nmedusa.admin.products.list({  \n order: \"created_at\",  \n})  \n.then(({ products, limit, offset, count }) => {  \n console.log(products.length)  \n})  \n```\n- Using Medusa React:\n```javascript\nimport React from \"react\"  \nimport { useAdminProducts } from \"medusa-react\"  \n  \nconst Products = () => {  \n const {   \n products,   \n isLoading,  \n } = useAdminProducts({  \n order: \"created_at\",  \n })  \n  \n return (  \n <div>  \n {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}  \n {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}  \n {products && products.length > 0 && (  \n <ul>  \n {products.map((product) => (  \n <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>  \n ))}  \n </ul>  \n )}  \n </div>  \n )  \n}  \n  \nexport default Products  \n```\nIf you have added a custom field and want to sort by it, you could try replacing `\"created_at\"` with your custom field name in the `order` parameter. If this doesn't work, it may be that Medusa does not support sorting by custom fields, or there may be additional steps required to enable this functionality.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Medusa documentation on [sorting in the JS Client](https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview#sort-order), [sorting in Medusa React](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview#sort-order), and [sorting in the Store API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#pagination)."

This issue was discussed in the context of a modal setup, where a click on a child div inside a fixed element was also closing the modal, as if the fixed element had a higher z-index.\n\nOne of the solutions suggested by the community was to ensure that the div containing the popover is not a child of the overlay. When the div containing the popover is a child of the overlay, clicking the overlay will hide it and its children. Therefore, shifting the child div popover outside and below the overlay div in the element tree might prevent the click event from being triggered on the parent component.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this solution might not work in all cases and the behavior might vary depending on the specific setup of your components.

This file will hold your extended repository. The name of the file must be the same as the name of the original repository in the core package. Since you're extending the `ProductVariant` repository, it's named `product_variant` to match the core.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement your extended repository:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ProductVariant } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"  \nimport {   \n dataSource,  \n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database\"  \nimport {  \n // alias the core repository to not cause a naming conflict  \n ProductVariantRepository as MedusaProductVariantRepository,  \n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/repositories/product_variant\"  \n  \nexport const ProductVariantRepository = dataSource  \n .getRepository(ProductVariant)  \n .extend({  \n // it is important to spread the existing repository here.  \n // Otherwise you will end up losing core properties  \n ...Object.assign(MedusaProductVariantRepository, {  \n target: ProductVariant,  \n }),  \n  \n /**  \n * Here you can create your custom function  \n * For example  \n */  \n customFunction(): void {  \n // TODO add custom implementation  \n return  \n },  \n })  \n  \nexport default ProductVariantRepository\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code is a general example and you might need to adjust it according to your needs. For instance, you might need to replace `customFunction` with your own custom methods.\n\nYou can learn more about extending a repository in the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/extend-repository).\n\nAlso, if you're using TypeScript, you might want to create a TypeScript declaration file to ensure TypeScript is aware of your extended entity. You can learn more about this in the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/extend-entity#optional-step-3-create-a-typescript-declaration-file)."

      "answer": "Sure, here's a simple guide to create a Hello World program using Next.js:\n\n1. First, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your machine. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs) project:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest hello-world\ncd hello-world\n```\n\nThis command creates a new folder called `hello-world`. This folder contains a boilerplate Next.js project. The CLI will prompt you to select different options like using TypeScript or Tailwind CSS.\n\n2. Start the development server by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNow, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You'll see the Next.js welcome page.\n\n3. To make a change, open the `app/page.js` file in a text editor. Delete the current contents of the file and paste in the following:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Page() { return ( <p>Hello, World!</p> )}\n```\n\nSave the file. Your browser updates instantly. This is [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) in action. It updates the browser as you save files, with no server reload needed.\n\nYou can learn more about how to use Next.js with the [official tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn), or get started from [Next.js templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js) to kickstart your development.\n\nSource: [Vercel Guide](https://vercel.com/guides/create-hello-world-react-app-nextjs)"

      "answer": "The `sv.LineZone::trigger()` function returns two boolean NumPy arrays. The first array indicates which detections have crossed the line from outside to inside, and the second array indicates which detections have crossed the line from inside to outside. \n\nIf you loop through these arrays and find an index that is `True`, it means that the object at that index in the detections list has crossed the line. To get more information about this object, you would need to refer back to the original detections list that you passed into the `trigger()` function.\n\nHere is an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\n# Assume `detections` is your list of detections\ncrossed_in, crossed_out = line_zone.trigger(detections)\n\nfor i, crossed in enumerate(crossed_in):\n    if crossed:\n        print(f\"Object {i} crossed in.

Details: {detections[i]}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `detections[i]` would give you the details of the object that crossed the line. The exact details available would depend on the structure of your detections list.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and might need to be adjusted based on your specific use case and the structure of your detections list.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [LineZone documentation](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/tools/line_zone)."

Paste the following code into the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3'  \nservices:  \n homarr:  \n container_name: homarr  \n image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest  \n restart: unless-stopped  \n volumes:  \n - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Optional, only if you want docker integration  \n - ./homarr/configs:/app/data/configs  \n - ./homarr/icons:/app/public/icons  \n - ./homarr/data:/data  \n ports:  \n - '7575:7575'  \n```\n\n3. Run the command `docker compose up -d` in the same directory where you created the `docker-compose.yml` file. This will start the Homarr container in the background.\n\nPlease note that Docker Compose creates a network by default. Some integrations may not work when the network internal hostname is used since clients do not know this name. It is recommended that you either use a local network wide hostname or the IP directly. An alternative is to create a DNS record with the same internal compose stack hostname for all clients outside.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [official Homarr installation guide](https://homarr.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#installation)."

When you enable the \"Only build pull requests\" feature, CircleCI will build when a pull request is opened and to commits to your default branch. You can view your project's default branch by using the get a Project API endpoint. If you change the default branch on your VCS provider, that change may not be immediately reflected on CircleCI. For GitHub, the default branch will be updated on the next commit push to CircleCI. For Bitbucket, you would need to manually refresh the project's information or contact CircleCI support to do it on your behalf [[source](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040969693-VCS-Default-Branch-Isn-t-Reflected-on-CircleCI#h_01H9163NMPYKS81J8KGXPKJ7DE)].\n\nOn the other hand, all branches include the default branch and any other branches in your repository. By default, CircleCI builds all branches. However, you can specify which branches to build or ignore using the `branches` key in your `config.yml` file. You can also use the `only` and `ignore` keys to control which branches should run the job. If neither `only` nor `ignore` are specified then all branches will run the job. If both `only` and `ignore` are specified, the `only` is used and `ignore` will have no effect [[source](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#schedule-branches)].\n\nYou can also add additional default branches by leveraging the CircleCI API.

      "question": "difference between summary and document summary index",
      "answer": "The Summary Index and Document Summary Index in LlamaIndex serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n\n1. **Summary Index**: A Summary Index is a simpler form of Index best suited to queries where you are trying to generate a summary of the text in your documents. It simply stores all of the documents and returns all of them to your query engine. This index is best suited for summarization queries that require the LLM to iterate through many if not most documents in order to synthesize an answer. For instance, a summarization query could look like one of the following: “What is a summary of this collection of text?” or “Give me a summary of person X’s experience with the company.” In general, a summary index would be suited for this use case. A summary index by default goes through all the data. Empirically, setting `response_mode=\"tree_summarize\"` also leads to better summarization results ([source](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/understanding/putting_it_all_together/q_and_a.html)).\n\n2. **Document Summary Index**: This index is a more specific form of index that extracts a summary from each document and stores that summary, as well as all nodes corresponding to the document. Retrieval can be performed through the LLM or embeddings. The relevant documents to the query are selected based on their summaries. All retrieved nodes corresponding to the selected documents are retrieved ([source](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.ipynb)).\n\nIn summary, while both indexes are used for summarization, the Summary Index is a more general form that goes through all the data, while the Document Summary Index is more specific and extracts summaries from each document individually."

You can create a `SummaryIndex` using the following code:\n\n```python\nsummary_index = SummaryIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)\n```\n(Source: [Retriever Router Query Engine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/query_engine/RetrieverRouterQueryEngine.html))\n\nIf you want to convert a `VectorStoreIndex` to a `SummaryIndex`, you might need to create a new `SummaryIndex` and populate it with the same nodes that are in your `VectorStoreIndex`. However, the exact method to do this is not provided in the knowledge sources. For more detailed information, you may want to refer to the [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/)."

      "answer": "Yes, you can create a VariadicList from an unknown number of arguments using the `__init__` method provided by the `VariadicList` class in Mojo. This method constructs a VariadicList from a variadic argument type. Here is the method signature:\n\n```python\n__init__(inout self: Self, *value: element_type)\n```\n\nThe `*value` parameter represents the variadic argument to construct the list with. This could be a DynamicVector of unknown size. \n\nHowever, please note that the VariadicList doesn't take ownership of its arguments. It's also important to note that the DynamicVector in Mojo can change its size at runtime, which makes it suitable for your requirement of unknown size.\n\nHere are the relevant links for more details:\n- [VariadicList](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list#variadiclist)\n- [DynamicVector](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#dynamicvector)"

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "When selecting a protocol for your IoT project, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Networking Technology**: Before starting a wireless design with Silicon Labs' wireless microcontrollers, you should first consider which of the available networking technologies would be most appropriate for your project. The choice of networking protocol depends on your specific use case and requirements. For instance, Wi-Fi is adept at transporting audio, video, and data throughout the home but demands a lot of power, limiting its utility for battery-powered applications. Bluetooth Smart is ideal for connecting point solutions to smartphones and for bulk data transfers on battery-powered devices. Mesh technologies such as ZigBee PRO and Thread form the backbone of a connected home, optimized to support low bandwidth control and automation applications where multi-year battery life is critical [source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Thread-Ushering-in-Era-of-Connectivity.pdf).\n\n2. **System Design**: Consider whether your product will fit best into a System-on-Chip (SOC) paradigm or a Network Coprocessor (NCP) paradigm. For the NCP, you need to decide what kind of serial communication to use for controlling the coprocessor [source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf).\n\n3. **Security**: Security is a crucial aspect of any IoT solution. Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation. Silicon Labs tools are designed to support the various levels of security provided by the protocol in question. You need to review and decide on the level of security required by your specific application and use cases [source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf).\n\n4. **Multiprotocol Implementation**: Implementing more than one protocol on a single device allows for cost savings, space savings, and energy savings. This approach requires careful consideration of the infrastructure requirements for an effective implementation [source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf).\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol will significantly impact the performance, power consumption, and overall success of your IoT project. Therefore, it's crucial to make an informed decision based on your project's specific needs and constraints."

      "answer": "To add incentives to a liquidity pool (LP) on Osmosis, you can create an external incentive gauge using the Osmosis Command Line Interface (CLI). Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, you need to run a command in the following format:\n```bash\nosmosisd tx incentives create-gauge [lockup_denom] [reward] [poolId] [flags]\n```\n- `[lockup_denom]` is the form of the pool's GAMM token such as gamm/pool/1. This can be set to 0 for Supercharged pools.\n- `[reward]` is the quantity of the base denom that you are adding to the pool, such as 1355000000uosmo for 1355 OSMO tokens.\n- `[poolId]` is the pool ID of the Supercharged pool. This should be set to 0 for Classic and Stableswap pools.\n- `[flags]` required specific to this transaction are:\n  - `--duration` which specifies the length of time that a provider must be bonded for to receive incentives. This is not required for Supercharged pools as there is no bonding. Typical values are 24h, 168h, and 336h.\n  - `--epochs` which specifies the number of days that these incentives will be distributed over.\n  - `--start-time` which specifies a Unix timestamp to begin incentives on, they will begin distribution the epoch after this time.\n\n2. Here's an example of a command for a Supercharged pool:\n```bash\nosmosisd tx incentives create-gauge 0 1355000000uosmo 1081 --epochs 30 --start-time 1698328800 --from Wosmongton --gas=auto --gas-prices 0.0025uosmo --gas-adjustment 1.3\n```\n3. And an example for a Classic Pool:\n```bash\nosmosisd tx incentives create-gauge gamm/pool/1 1355000000uosmo 0 --duration 336h --epochs 30 --start-time 1698328800 --from Wosmongton --gas=auto --gas-prices 0.0025uosmo --gas-adjustment 1.3\n```\nPlease note that there is a small fee in OSMO to create a gauge, which is transferred from the running wallet's balance to the Osmosis Community Pool. At the time of writing, this is 50 OSMO.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Osmosis documentation](https://docs.osmosis.zone/overview/integrate/incentives#creating-an-external-incentives-gauge)."

You also need to annotate your Connector implementation with the `@OutboundConnector` annotation, where you provide the metadata needed for runtime configuration.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet for the connector function:\n\n```java\n@OutboundConnector(\n       name = \"OpenWeatherAPI\", \n       inputVariables = {\"latitude\", \"longitude\", \"units\", \"apiKey\"}, \n       type = \"io.camunda:weather-api:1\"\n)\npublic class OpenWeatherAPIFunction implements OutboundConnectorFunction {\n```\n\nIn this code, `type` refers to the task type that your connector will service. This needs to match the value provided for `zeebe:taskDefinition:type` in the connector template. This is how Zeebe knows to use this connector implementation for tasks that use your connector template in the model.\n\nThe `inputVariables` field is important. This is passed to the runtime and informs the `fetchVariables` parameter of the connector worker. If you do not specify a variable name here, that variable will not be visible to the connector at run-time, even if it is present in the process variables.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to these sources: [source 1](https://camunda.com/blog/2022/11/how-to-build-camunda-platform-8-connector), [source 2](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk#outbound-connector-runtime-logic), [source 3](https://forum.camunda.io/t/40276)."

      "answer": "LlamaIndex provides a swappable storage layer that allows you to customize where ingested documents (i.e., `Node` objects), embedding vectors, and index metadata are stored. If you don't want to store embeddings in a document store, you can choose to use a different type of storage such as a vector store or an index store.\n\nFor instance, if you have already computed embeddings and dumped them into an external vector store (e.g. Pinecone, Chroma), you can use it with LlamaIndex by using the following code:\n\n```python\nvector_store = PineconeVectorStore(pinecone.Index(\"quickstart\"))\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store=vector_store)\n```\n(Source: [Vector Store Index usage examples](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/module_guides/indexing/vector_store_guide.ipynb))\n\nYou can also customize the underlying storage with a one-line change to instantiate different document stores, index stores, and vector stores. For more details, you can refer to the guides on [Document Stores](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/docstores.html), [Vector Stores](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/vector_stores.html), and [Index Stores](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/index_stores.html).\n\n(Source: [Customizing Storage](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/customization.html))"

      "question": "How does unstructured deliver back partioned files? Is it JSON? And how do work with it?",
      "answer": "Unstructured delivers partitioned files in a structured format that can be easily processed for further use. The partitioning functions in Unstructured break a document down into elements such as `Title`, `NarrativeText`, and `ListItem`, enabling users to decide what content they’d like to keep for their particular application. The output of these partitioning functions can be used directly for further processing or analysis.\n\nThe `partition` function is the simplest API in the library. It detects the filetype of the source document and routes it to the appropriate partitioning function. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\n\nelements = partition(filename=\"example-10k.html\")\n```\n\nYou can also pass in a file as a file-like object using the following workflow:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"example-10k.html\", \"rb\") as f:\n    elements = partition(file=f)\n```\n\nThe `partition` function uses `libmagic` for filetype detection. If `libmagic` is not present and the user passes a filename, `partition` falls back to detecting the filetype using the file extension.\n\nAs for the output format, the Unstructured API provides several parameters to customize the processing of documents. One of these parameters is `output_format`. The format of the response can be either `application/json` or `text/csv`, with the default being `application/json`.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Unstructured documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/introduction/getting_started.html)."

The knowledge sources provided do not contain specific information on how to optimally use `sst-auth` with Next.js 14's server/client component architecture. \n\nHowever, I can tell you that SST provides a construct called `Auth` which can be used to create an Authorize URL and a Callback URL for authentication flows. This can be used in conjunction with the `Api` construct in your SST stack. Here's an example of how to configure the `Auth` construct:\n\n```javascript\nconst auth = new Auth(stack, \"auth\", {\n  authenticator: {\n    handler: \"packages/functions/src/auth.handler\",\n  },\n});\nauth.attach(stack, {\n  api,\n  prefix: \"/auth\",\n});\n```\nIn this example, the `Auth` construct creates a `/auth/*` catch-all route.

It allows you to set up one or more unidirectional replication flows between different universes. A universe in YugabyteDB is a term used to describe a single running instance of a YugabyteDB database. xCluster can only be used to replicate between primary clusters in two different universes; it cannot be used to replicate between clusters in the same universe.\n\nFor each flow, data is replicated from a source (also called a producer) universe to a target (also called a consumer) universe. Replication is done at the DocDB level, with newly committed writes in the source universe asynchronously replicated to the target universe. Both YSQL and YCQL are supported.\n\nMultiple flows can be used; for example, two unidirectional flows between two universes, one in each direction, produce bidirectional replication where anything written in one universe will be replicated to the other. Data is only asynchronously replicated once to avoid infinite loops.\n\nxCluster is more flexible than a hypothetical scheme whereby read replicas are promoted to full replicas when primary replicas are lost because it does not require the two universes to be tightly coupled. With xCluster, for example, the same table can be split into tablets in different ways in the two universes. xCluster also allows for bidirectional replication, which is not possible using read replicas because read replicas cannot take writes.\n\nSources:\n- [YugabyteDB's xCluster replication Part 1](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/architecture/docdb-replication/async-replication#yugabytedb-s-xcluster-replication)\n- [YugabyteDB's xCluster replication Part 2](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/docdb-replication/async-replication#yugabytedb-s-xcluster-replication)"

      "question": "banner is not responsive",
      "answer": "If your banner image is not responsive, it might be due to the actual size and particularly the height of your image. Archetype themes use responsive imagery to adjust your images based on the desktop and mobile height settings you have configured in the Hero (optional slideshow) section. This may require the image to responsively adjust in order to span the full-width of the section. When this adjustment occurs, you may find areas of your image are getting cropped.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to ensure your images look their best:\n\n1. Set a focal point: Use [focal points](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2729) wherever possible to choose which part of your image is the focus (a person, a product, etc.). This determines what part of the image shouldn't be cropped while the image is enlarged to fit the device.\n\n2. Adjust your section heights: You can specify a desktop height and mobile-specific height for most image-based sections. Adjust these until the right balance of your image is visible at both sizes.\n\n3. Avoid designing images with their own text: While traditionally effective on desktop, these wide and short images lead to hard-to-read text and very small images on mobile devices due to the aspect ratio differences between devices. Instead, use theme settings to apply text and buttons to an image with sections like the Slideshow.\n\nIf you're finding that your slideshow image is getting cropped in ways you didn't expect, try setting the Desktop height to Natural and uncheck Enable parallax. This Natural height setting will honor the original height of your image and reduce the potential of your image getting cropped. Be sure to check out the [image and video size recommendations](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2716) for best results.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to these articles on [responsive imagery](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/230400) and [how to stop slideshow images from getting cropped](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/278336)."

The initial circulating supply is 1.8 billion, distributed in ERC20 and SPL formats across 5 initial chains: Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. The token is allocated across six main categories: Guardian Nodes, Community & Launch, Core Contributors, Ecosystem & Incubation, Strategic Network Participants, and the Foundation Treasury. 82% of the tokens are initially locked and set to unlock over four years. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the token allocation:\n\n- **Guardian Nodes**: 5.1% (510,000,000 W) of the token supply. Guardian nodes provide the primary verification mechanism for any message passing through Wormhole. None of the Guardian’s allocated token supply will be unlocked at the TGE and those W are subject to the Token Release Schedule.\n\n- **Community & Launch**: 17% (1,700,000,000 W) of the token supply. 11% of this allocation will be unlocked at TGE and will be distributed during the initial phases of the TGE, including the TGE-related airdrop (and related activities). The remaining 6% will be unlocked four months after TGE, in accordance with the Token Release Schedule.\n\n- **Core Contributors**: 12% (1,200,000,000 W) of the token supply. This portion of the token supply was reserved for the decentralized set of core contributing organizations who have tirelessly focused on the security, engineering, product, infrastructure, growth, and operations of the Wormhole platform. None of their W will be unlocked at TGE and such W will unlock in accordance with the Token Release Schedule.\n\n- **Strategic Network Participants**: 11.6% (1,160,000,000 W) of the supply has been reserved to allow strategic network participants to take a vested interest in the long-term success and stability of the network through private sales. None of the strategic participants’ tokens will be unlocked at TGE and are subject to the Token Release Schedule.\n\nThe tokenomics structure is designed to support Wormhole's long-term success, stability, and progressive decentralization. W is a native Solana SPL token and native ERC20 token that leverages Wormhole’s Native Token Transfers (NTT) framework for multichain functionality and can be transferred seamlessly to any Wormhole-connected network.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following sources:\n- [W Airdrop Explained](https://wormhole.com/w-airdrop-explained#tokenomics-and-airdrop-details)\n- [Wormhole (W) Tokenomics](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-w-tokenomics)\n- [W Powering Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/w)\n- [Governance and the Wormhole DAO](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-w-tokenomics#governance-and-the-wormhole-dao)\n- [Strategic Stakeholders](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-w-tokenomics#strategic-stakeholders)"

      "answer": "Roboflow supports a wide variety of formats for exporting datasets. The available formats include but are not limited to JSON, Mask, TXT, CSV, XML, YOLO, COCO, TensorFlow, and many more. If you're only seeing JSON and Mask as options, it could be due to the specific type of dataset you're working with. For instance, certain formats may be more suitable for object detection, single-label classification, multi-label classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation datasets.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, it might be a good idea to check your dataset and the settings you're using. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Roboflow's support for further assistance.\n\nHere are some resources that might help:\n- [Roboflow Export Data Documentation](https://docs.roboflow.com/datasets/exporting-data)\n- [Roboflow API Reference for Export Data](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/export-data)\n- [Roboflow Blog Post on Exporting Dataset Versions](https://blog.roboflow.com/launch-version-export-and-train-models-in-the-roboflow-python-package#export-dataset-versions)\n- [Roboflow Blog Post on Converting Annotation Formats](https://blog.roboflow.com/convert-annotation-formats)"

      "answer": "There could be several reasons why you're unable to deploy a stack in Portainer. Here are a few potential issues and solutions based on the knowledge sources provided:\n\n1. **Overlapping Network Definitions**: Check your Docker Networks. If you have overlapping network definitions, it could cause deployment errors. For instance, if you've created a Docker Network with the same Subnet as your home network, all Docker-based traffic might not be able to access your home network or the internet, causing the stack deployment to fail [[source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/6399)].\n\n2. **Authentication Issues with Git Repository**: If you're deploying a stack with GitOps polling from a private repository, make sure your saved credentials for the git repository are correct. If the credentials are incorrect or outdated, it could cause the stack deployment to fail [[source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10662)].\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: If you're deploying a stack from a git repository and you've entered environment variables into the UI, make sure the `stack.env` file is being created correctly. If Portainer is unable to find the `stack.env` file, it could cause the stack deployment to fail [[source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10902)].\n\n4. **Slow Stack Deployments**: If your stack deployments are slow, it could be due to the Portainer environment's authentication process with configured registries. Make sure the registry credentials are correct and up-to-date for each registry and check the networking between the Portainer environment and each registry [[source](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/why-are-stack-deployment-times-slow)].\n\n5. **Retry Deployment**: If a deployment fails, by default Portainer will not try and redeploy the stack. However, you can enable a retry policy on your stacks in Portainer Business Edition. With retry deployment enabled, Portainer will keep trying to redeploy your stack if it runs into deployment errors [[source](https://docs.portainer.io/user/edge/stacks#retry-deployment)].\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it would be helpful to have more specific details about the error message you're receiving and your current setup."

This means it is capable of automatic serialization and deserialization, making it transmittable between the server and the client. \n\nIn Serverpod, the `SerializableEntity` is the base class for all serializable objects, except primitives. By extending the `SerializableEntity` class, the `FlashlistBatch` object becomes capable of automatic serialization and deserialization.

Labels can assist with identifying components you want to review, approve, or even avoid altogether. This is referred to as component label assignment [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/component-labels.html).\n\nTo create a component label, you need to follow these steps:\n1. Click the *Organization & Policies* icon on the IQ Server toolbar.\n2. Select the organization or application in which the component label will be used.\n3. In the *Organization & Policies* area, click *Component Labels*.\n4. In the *Component Labels* section, click the *Add a Label* button. The *New Component Label* editor is displayed.\n5. In the *New Component Label* editor, set the following attributes:\n   - *Component Label Name* - Enter a name for the component label that is easily identified.\n   - *Short Description* - Enter a description that provides additional information about the component label.\n   - *Color* - Select a desired color for the component label.\n6. Click the *Create* button to add the component label to the selected organization [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/component-labels.html).\n\nComponent labels can be assigned to components found in an application report or through the Component Label API. The process involves opening the report for your application with the target components, selecting the component to open the component's information panel, and then selecting the labels tab. This will display two panels: Applied (labels assigned to the component) and Available (labels scoped to the application). You can then select the label on the Available side to set the scope of the label, or select the label on the Applied side to remove the label from the component [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/assigning-component-labels.html).\n\nPlease note that component labels can only be edited (or deleted) at the level they were created.

      "answer": "If your custom color swatch doesn't appear on the product detail page (PDP), it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Incorrect Naming**: The theme looks for any variant category with the name \"Color\" or \"Colour\". If you've changed the word to something other than \"Color/Colour\", you need to update it in your languages area under Edit theme content > Products > General > Color swatch trigger. Also, the theme will look for an HTML color name or a .png image file in Content > Files with a filename-friendly version of your variant name. For example, Green swatches would need to be named green.png (capitals become lowercase) and Heather grey swatches would need to be named heather-grey.png (capitals become lowercase, spaces and other special characters become hyphens). .jpg files will not be shown, you must use .png. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2765)\n\n2. **Theme Cache**: The theme caches color swatch files so they load faster. If you've changed the swatch, it won't be updated right away. To force your swatches to update to the new image you've uploaded, you'll need to modify the code in these three files: snippets/product-grid-item.liquid, snippets/variant-button.liquid, and snippets/collection-sidebar-filters.liquid. You'll need to remove the code **| split: '?' |** first. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2766)\n\n3. **Theme Trial**: If you're using a theme trial in your online store, Shopify restricts access to your language settings until a theme purchase has been made. For testing, it's recommended to use the default 'Color' variant name. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2765)\n\nIf you've checked all these and the issue persists, it might be due to a third-party application or modifications made to your theme's code, disrupting its native functionalities.

      "answer": "Updating your Archetype theme to the latest version is crucial to take advantage of the latest features, bug fixes, and Shopify enhancements. Here are the three options you have when it comes to updating your theme:\n\n1. **Manual Update:** This is a good option if you've only made minor changes to your theme code. You can download the latest version from the Shopify theme store and install it in your theme library as an unpublished theme. Then, you can copy all your sections and settings over from your old theme. If you're on a newer theme version that supports Online Store 2.0, you can also copy over your homepage sections and the templates for pages, products, and collections. Custom templates can be brought over using the same process, but you'll need to create the JSON template in the new theme files since they won't exist there by default. More details can be found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/templates#create-a-new-template).\n\n2. **Theme Updater Plus app:** Archetype Themes has partnered with Out of the Sandbox to include support for all of their themes when using the Theme Updater Plus app. This app can automate some of the manual steps required in a theme update and can also carry over simple changes that have been made directly to the theme code. However, if you or your developer have made extensive or complex customizations to the theme files, these will still need to be manually transferred to the updated theme. Merchants who have purchased any Archetype Theme will automatically receive a 14-day free trial of the Theme Updater app.\n\n3. **Working with an Expert:** Archetype partners with several Shopify Experts who offer theme update services. Teams at [Storetasker](https://www.storetasker.com/partners/archetype) or [HeyCarson](https://heycarson.com/ambassadors?ref=archetypethemes) are great options. They are experienced, vetted Shopify developers who can handle more complex update scenarios.\n\nRemember, Archetype themes do not offer theme update services, so you'll need to do this yourself or with the help of 3rd party experts or an app.\n\nSources:\n- [How do I update my theme?](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2767)\n- [Updating your theme with Theme Updater Plus](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/207424)\n- [Working with an Expert](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2767)"

      "question": "compatibility problems in updated chrome",
      "answer": "There can be several compatibility issues when using an updated version of Chrome with Foundry VTT on The Forge. Here are some common issues and their solutions:\n\n1. **Hardware Acceleration**: Foundry VTT requires Hardware Accelerated WebGL to function properly. If this is disabled in your browser, you might face issues. You can enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings. If you're still facing issues, you might need to force Chrome to ignore the GPU blocklist. You can do this by opening `chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist` in Chrome and setting the option to Enabled [[source](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/11036)].\n\n2. **High RAM Usage**: If Chrome is using a lot of RAM, it can degrade performance over time. This could be due to a module using a lot of resources. In such cases, it's recommended to disable all modules, use safe configuration, and only enable the modules that you need. Refreshing the page can also help in such situations [[source](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/17087)].\n\n3. **Graphics Settings**: If Chrome is not using your high-performance GPU, you might face issues like screen flickering. You can change this in Windows Settings → Graphics. Assign Chrome to use “High Performance”. Or disable the Integrated GPU in your BIOS [[source](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/14999)].\n\nRemember to keep your Foundry system updated to the latest stable version and update the system to the latest version for the best performance [[source](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/troubleshooting-in-forge-foundry/11293)]."

      "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with VRChat. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. **Reset your avatar**: If your avatar is causing issues, you can reset it by pressing the keys `Ctrl` and `\\` simultaneously while in the VRChat application. This will set you to a grey robot avatar locally, allowing you to change to a different avatar. If you're unable to load into a world to reset your avatar for any reason, hold down both the Quick Menu buttons for the duration of loading a world and your avatar will be reset upon load-in. If you use a VRChat account, you can navigate to the VRChat website, go to the Avatars section, and select \"Reset to Default Avatar\". [Here's the link](https://vrchat.com/home/avatars) ([source](https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060847634-Unable-to-switch-out-of-an-avatar)).\n\n2. **Check your connection**: Make sure you have a reliable connection to Cloudflare, AWS Cloudfront, and Photon Engine and a stable connection to download content such as Worlds and Avatars. You can check the [VRChat Status](https://status.vrchat.com/) page to ensure no outages or ongoing issues have been reported. If you're using Meta Quest, there are specific troubleshooting steps you can follow ([source](https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062658433-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues-with-VRChat)).\n\n3. **Optimize performance**: If you're experiencing performance issues or heavy frame drops, you can use the 'Performance Options' button on the top-right of your Safety Menu to increase the minimum requirement for displayed avatars and reduce the maximum avatar download size. You can also enable the 'Convert All Dynamic Bones To Phys Bones' option to ensure that you're utilizing Phys Bones which are more resource efficient. If you continue to have issues beyond this point, you can [submit a Support Ticket](http://vrch.at/support) ([source](https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/10292084930323-I-m-experiencing-performance-issues-heavy-frame-drops)).\n\nIf none of these steps work, it might be a good idea to reach out to VRChat support for further assistance."

      "answer": "The `useCustom` hook in Refine is used to send custom query requests. It is an extended version of TanStack Query's `useQuery` and supports all features of the mutation along with some extra features. It uses the `custom` method as the query function from the `dataProvider` which is passed to `<Refine>`.\n\nHere is a basic usage example of `useCustom`:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useCustom, useApiUrl } from \"@refinedev/core\";  \n  \ninterface PostUniqueCheckResponse {  \n isAvailable: boolean;  \n}  \n  \nconst apiUrl = useApiUrl();  \n  \nconst { data, isLoading } = useCustom<PostUniqueCheckResponse>({  \n url: `${apiUrl}/posts-unique-check`,  \n method: \"get\",  \n config: {  \n headers: {  \n \"x-custom-header\": \"foo-bar\",  \n },  \n query: {  \n title: \"Foo bar\",  \n },  \n },  \n});  \n```\n\nIn this example, `useCustom` is used to send a GET request to the `posts-unique-check` endpoint. The response is then stored in the `data` variable.\n\nHowever, the `useCustom` hook does not directly support handling the response as a blob. You would need to handle the response conversion in your `dataProvider`'s `custom` method or in the component where you use the `useCustom` hook.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [useCustom documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-custom)."

By default, in Temporal Cloud, the retention period for workflow history data is 30 days. Users can extend this limit up to 90 days. However, for those looking for longer-term data storage, Temporal offers a feature called Workflow History Export. This feature allows users to export closed workflow histories on a per-namespace basis to an AWS S3 cloud storage bucket, thereby retaining and preserving historical workflow data for compliance, auditing, and further analysis [[source](https://temporal.io/blog/introducing-workflow-history-export)].\n\nIn the Temporal Web UI, after a workflow completes, the full history persists for a set retention period (typically 7 to 30 days) before the history is deleted. Users can set up the Archival feature to send these entries to long-term storage for compliance or audit needs [[source](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/first_program_in_go#start-the-worker), [source](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/python/first_program_in_python#start-the-worker), [source](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/typescript/first_program_in_typescript#start-the-worker)].\n\nThere are also limits in place to keep a single Workflow execution from running forever: 50Ki (51,200) Events in the Event History and an Event History size of 50MB. If either limit is reached, the Workflow is Terminated with an error of, “Workflow history size / count exceeds limit” [[source](https://temporal.io/blog/very-long-running-workflows)].\n\nIn the Java SDK, there are methods to get the length and size of the Workflow history up until the current moment of execution.

Click on \"Transfer\" in the Accounts menu or click the \"Send\" button on the Accounts page next to the account you want to send from. This will take you to a pop-up window where you can enter the destination account and the amount you want to send.\n\n2. Enter all the details and click on the \"Make Transfer\" button. This will display your expected transaction fees in milli DOT.\n\nHowever, if your account holds exactly 1 DOT or is very close to it, you might not see the option to transfer the full account balance. In this case, send a small amount of DOT to this account to increase the transferable balance so that the transaction fee can be deducted without the transferable balance dropping below 1 DOT. Transaction fees are very low on Polkadot, so increasing the balance to even 1.02 DOT should be sufficient, but to be safe, it's recommended that you have at least 1.1 DOT.\n\nIf your account has other types of balances like locked or reserved, you must manually enter the amount you want to send. The transferable balance can be below 1 DOT, but if it's too low, the UI won't let you send out funds.\n\nPlease note that only the transferable balance can be sent out of your account. Your locked and reserved balance can't be moved. But it can be made transferable if or when the locks are removed or the reasons for the reserves cease to exist.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, please refer to these articles:\n- [How to Send / Transfer Funds Out of Your Account](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000170304-polkadot-js-ui-how-to-send-transfer-funds-out-of-your-account)\n- [How to Send All of Your Funds Out of Your Account](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000170293-how-to-send-all-of-your-funds-out-of-your-account)\n- [Why Can't I Transfer My DOT?](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169437-why-can-t-i-transfer-my-dot-)"

Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst userId = 42\nconst result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId};`\n```\n\nIn this example, a placeholder named `${userId}` is included in the query. The benefits of using the tagged template versions of `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw` include:\n\n- Prisma Client escapes all variables.\n- Tagged templates are database-agnostic - you do not need to remember if variables should be written as `$1` (PostgreSQL) or `?` (MySQL).\n- SQL Template Tag gives you access to useful helpers.\n- Embedded, named variables are easier to read.\n\nHowever, you cannot pass a table or column name into a tagged template placeholder. For example, you cannot `SELECT ?` and pass in `*` or `id, name` based on some condition.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries#using-variables)."

Each element has a classification and associated metadata.\n\nThere are many more customizations you can make. For example, you can specify what languages to use for OCR with the `ocr_languages` kwarg. For example, use `ocr_languages=\"eng+deu\"` to use the English and German language packs. OCR is only applied if the text is not already available in the PDF document.\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf\n\n# Applies the English and Swedish language pack for ocr. OCR is only applied\n# if the text is not available in the PDF.\nelements = partition_pdf(\"path/to/your/pdf_file.pdf\", ocr_languages=\"eng+swe\")\n```\n\nIf a PDF is copy protected, `partition_pdf` can process the document with the `hi_res` strategy (which will treat it like an image), but cannot process the document with the `fast` strategy. If the user chooses `fast` on a copy protected PDF, `partition_pdf` will fall back to the `hi_res` strategy.\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf\n\n# This will process without issue\nelements = partition_pdf(\"path/to/your/copy-protected.pdf\", strategy=\"hi_res\")\n\n# This will output a warning and fall back to hi_res\nelements = partition_pdf(\"path/to/your/copy-protected.pdf\", strategy=\"fast\")\n```\n\nFor a full breakdown of the `partition_pdf` function, you can check the [documentation here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/core/partition.html).\n\nSources: \n- [Unstructured Core Partitioning](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/core/partition.html)\n- [Unstructured Blog](https://unstructured.io/blog/how-to-process-pdf-in-python)"

Network volumes are billed on a per-hour basis [source](https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#how-does-network-volume-billing-work).\n\nWhen it comes to Pod storage, RunPod charges $0.10 GB per month for all storage on running Pods and $0.20 GB per month for volume storage on stopped Pods. Storage is tied to compute servers, and charges are applied per minute. RunPod does not charge users if the host machine is down or unavailable from the public internet [source](https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#billing).\n\nA Pod consists of several resources, including a Container Disk and an Instance Volume. The Container Disk is temporary and removed when the pod is stopped or terminated. You only pay for the container disk when the pod is running. The Instance Volume, on the other hand, persists even when you reset or stop a Pod. The volume is removed when the Pod is terminated. You pay for volume storage even when the Pod is stopped [source](https://docs.runpod.io/sdks/graphql/manage-pods#create-pods).\n\nPlease note that RunPod is not designed to be a cloud storage system; storage is provided in the pursuit of running tasks using its GPUs, and not meant to be a long-term backup solution. It is highly advisable to continually back up anything you want to save offsite locally or to a cloud provider [source](https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#how-does-network-volume-billing-work)."

      "answer": "Yes, you are correct. In the provided example, `node_0_tups` contains triplets related to one node only. Each tuple in `node_0_tups` represents a relationship in the form of a triplet (subject, relationship, object). These triplets are manually added to the Knowledge Graph for a specific node, in this case `nodes[0]`.\n\nHere is the relevant code snippet:\n\n```python\n# for node 0\nnode_0_tups = [\n    (\"author\", \"worked on\", \"writing\"),\n    (\"author\", \"worked on\", \"programming\"),\n]\nfor tup in node_0_tups:\n    index.upsert_triplet_and_node(tup, nodes[0])\n```\n\nIn this code, `node_0_tups` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a relationship. The `for` loop iterates over each tuple in `node_0_tups`, and for each tuple, it calls the `upsert_triplet_and_node` method on the `index` object, passing in the tuple and the node (`nodes[0]`) as arguments. This method adds the relationship represented by the tuple to the specified node in the Knowledge Graph.\n\nThis process is repeated for each node for which you want to manually add relationships. For example, the code also shows how to add relationships for a second node (`nodes[1]`).\n\nSources: \n- [KnowledgeGraphDemo.html](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo.html)\n- [KnowledgeGraphDemo.ipynb](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo.ipynb)"

      "question": "I stored object refs in a list. Let's say we remove a ref from the list. What will happen to the object?",
      "answer": "In Ray, objects are managed using a distributed reference counting system. When an `ObjectRef` is in scope anywhere in the cluster, it is pinned in the object store. This includes local Python references, arguments to pending tasks, and IDs serialized inside of other objects ([source](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/memory-management.html)).\n\nIf you remove an `ObjectRef` from a list, and there are no other references to that object in your application, the object will be eligible for garbage collection. This means that Ray's memory management system may decide to remove the object from the object store to free up space. If you try to access the object after it has been garbage collected, you will get an error.\n\nHowever, if there are other references to the object elsewhere in your application, the object will remain in the object store until all references are out of scope. This is because Ray implements distributed reference counting, which means that an object will remain in the object store as long as there is at least one reference to it in the cluster.\n\nIn the context of nested objects, Ray will keep the inner object alive via reference counting until all outer object references are deleted ([source](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/objects.html)).\n\nRemember that Ray's object store is based on the design principle of immutable objects. This design decision is to simplify the consistency model ([source](https://discuss.ray.io/t/8124)).\n\nHere's an example of how Ray handles garbage collection of object references from a generator ([source](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/ray-generator.html)):\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef task():\n    for i in range(5):\n        time.sleep(1)\n        yield i\n\ngen = task.remote()\nref1 = next(gen)\ndel gen\n```\n\nIn this example, `ref1` is a normal Ray object reference after Ray returns it. Other references that aren’t consumed with `next(gen)` are removed when the generator is garbage collected. In this case, garbage collection happens when you call `del gen`."

This feature has been requested by users in the Prisma community, as seen in this [Github issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5430). \n\nThe suggested solution in the issue is to create TTL indexes on the model and let the database handle automatic removal of documents after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time. However, this is not currently possible with Prisma.\n\nAs an alternative, users have suggested using a cron job to check for an expiring timestamp and delete old records, which can be heavy on the application. Another user suggested a simpler version using timestamps as `expireTTL DateTime @expire` or `expireTTL DateTime @ttl`.\n\nFor caching data, Prisma does support a Time-to-Live (TTL) feature. The TTL determines how long cached data is considered fresh. By specifying the `ttl` in seconds, you can control the duration for which data in the cache remains valid. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```javascript\nawait prisma.user.findMany({ cacheStrategy: { ttl: 60, },});\n```\n\nIn this example, with a specified TTL of 60 seconds, the majority of requests will result in a cache hit throughout the TTL duration. This is useful for reducing database load and latency for data that does not require frequent updates. You can read more about this in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/accelerate/caching#time-to-live-ttl).\n\nRemember to always regenerate your Prisma Client with `npx prisma generate` after updating the schema to ensure that it is in sync with the latest schema, as suggested by a Prisma maintainer in this [discussion](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/19989)."

      "answer": "The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch between the `PolicyStatement` you're trying to assign and the expected `Permission` type. In SST, the `permissions` property of the `NextjsSite` construct expects a `Permission` type, not a `PolicyStatement`.\n\nHere are three possible solutions:\n\n1. **Give full permissions**: This allows the function admin access to all resources. You can do this by passing a wildcard string `'*'` to the `permissions` property.\n\n```javascript\nconst site = new NextjsSite(stack, \"site\", {\n  // other properties...\n  permissions: [\"*\"],\n});\n```\n\n2. **Access to a list of services**: Specify a list of AWS resource types that this function has complete access to. Takes a list of strings.\n\n```javascript\nconst site = new NextjsSite(stack, \"site\", {\n  // other properties...\n  permissions: [\"scheduler\", \"iam\"],\n});\n```\n\n3. **Access to a list of SST constructs**: To give access to SST constructs, bind them to the function. \n\n```javascript\nconst site = new NextjsSite(stack, \"site\", {\n  // other properties...\n  bind: [myTable, ...Object.values(secretParams)],\n});\n```\n\nPlease note that in the third solution, the `bind` property is used instead of `permissions`. This is because the `bind` property is designed to work with SST constructs, while the `permissions` property is designed to work with strings representing AWS services or actions.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [SST Permissions documentation](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/Permissions#examples)."

      "question": "is there anyway to use uuids with capacitor sqlite?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use UUIDs with Capacitor SQLite. UUIDs are not specific to any database or technology, they are a universal unique identifier that can be used anywhere. \n\nWhen using SQLite with Capacitor, you can generate UUIDs in your application code (in JavaScript or TypeScript) and then store them as text in SQLite. \n\nFor example, if you are using the `capacitor-sqlite` or `cordova-plugin-sqlite` plugins mentioned in the [Capacitor documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/next/guides/storage#large-data-or-high-performance-storage-options), you can create a table with a column for UUIDs like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE my_table (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT);\n```\n\nThen, when you insert data, you can generate a UUID in your application code and insert it as a string:\n\n```javascript\nlet uuid = generateUUID(); // replace this with your UUID generation code\nlet data = 'some data';\nlet sql = `INSERT INTO my_table (id, data) VALUES ('${uuid}', '${data}')`;\n```\n\nPlease replace `generateUUID()` with your own function or library for generating UUIDs. There are many libraries available for generating UUIDs in JavaScript, such as the [uuid library on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid).\n\nRemember to handle SQL injection and properly escape or parameterize your SQL queries when inserting data into SQLite."

      "answer": "If your frontend app's API key is exposed, it is indeed possible for someone to misuse it to send false data to your Amplitude project. This is because API keys can be found in a website's source code and are somewhat public. However, it's important to note that your data can only be exported if someone has both your API and Secret Key.\n\nIn the unlikely event that you start receiving false data due to misuse of your API key, you should let Amplitude know and they can reset the key for you. If you want to be extra careful, you could add a little obfuscation to the API key in your HTML or JavaScript code. For example:\n\n```javascript\namplitude.getInstance().init(getKey(<encoded_key>, <secret>));\n```\n\nIn this example, you would need to implement the obfuscation/encoding logic of `getKey`.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you have an open-source project and you're considering hard-coding your project API key into it, you should be aware of the potential risks. If hackers acquire your open-source project, they might send excessive requests to Amplitude’s system using your project API key with ill intentions and without your supervision. \n\nIf you're concerned about this, you could consider creating a proxy service on your server to prevent misuse of your API key. This would involve redirecting the events to Amplitude after authenticating the request. However, this solution would have its own costs.\n\nSources:\n- [Community Question > Data-instrumentation-57 > Is it OK to include project API key in open source project?](https://community.amplitude.com/data-instrumentation-57/is-it-ok-to-include-project-api-key-in-open-source-project-1938)\n- [Community Question > Data-instrumentation-57 > Api key is exposed publicly if I am using the the JS SDK.

      "answer": "To set up Seldon Core V2 with NGINX, you need to follow several steps:\n\n1. **Enable Core v2 support in Seldon Enterprise Platform**: You need to modify your `deploy-values.yaml` file to enable Core v2 support. Here is the code you need to add or change:\n\n```yaml\nseldonCoreV2:\n enabled: true\n```\n\nAfter modifying your `deploy-values.yaml`, you need to apply it with the following command:\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade seldon-deploy seldon-charts/seldon-deploy \\\n -f deploy-values.yaml \\\n --namespace=seldon-system \\\n --version 2.2.0 \\\n --install\n```\n\nThen, ensure that the Seldon Enterprise Platform deployment restarts to pick up the new configuration:\n\n```bash\nkubectl rollout status deployment/seldon-deploy -n seldon-system\n```\n\n(Source: [Enable Core v2 support in Seldon Enterprise Platform](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/latest/contents/getting-started/production-installation/core-v2.html#enable-core-v2-support-in-seldon-enterprise-platform))\n\n2. **Provision a server**: To run models, you need to provision a server. You can install pre-configured Seldon Core v2 Servers. Create a `servers-values.yaml` file and conduct a Helm installation with the following commands:\n\n```yaml\nmlserver:\n replicas: 1\n\ntriton:\n replicas: 1\n```\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade seldon-core-v2-servers seldon-charts/seldon-core-v2-servers \\\n --version 2.7.0 \\\n -f servers-values.yaml \\\n --namespace seldon \\\n --install\n```\n\n(Source: [Servers](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/latest/contents/getting-started/production-installation/core-v2.html#servers))\n\n3. **Expose Seldon Mesh**: The Seldon Core v2 inference API is exposed via the `seldon-mesh` service. To expose this service via NGINX ingress, you need to create an Ingress. Create a `seldon-mesh-ingress.yaml` file and apply it with the following commands:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n name: seldon-mesh\n namespace: seldon\n annotations:\n nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: GRPC\nspec:\n tls:\n rules:\n - host: seldon.inference.seldon\n http:\n paths:\n - path: /\n pathType: Prefix\n backend:\n service:\n name: seldon-mesh\n port:\n number: 80\n - host: seldon.admin.seldon\n http:\n paths:\n - path: /\n pathType: Prefix\n backend:\n service:\n name: seldon-scheduler\n port:\n number: 9004\n ingressClassName: nginx\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f seldon-mesh-ingress.yaml\n```\n\n(Source: [Expose Seldon Mesh](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/latest/contents/getting-started/production-installation/core-v2.html#expose-seldon-mesh))\n\nPlease note that you need to have Helm and kubectl installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster."

      "answer": "To try out the object detection features with a model on Roboflow, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Roboflow account**: If you don't have one already, create a free Roboflow account. This will allow you to access an API key which you can use to test a pre-trained model. You can create an account [here](https://app.roboflow.com/?ref=blog.roboflow.com).\n\n2. **Find the Model ID and version**: To access the trained model for object detection, you'll need to identify the model ID and version number associated with the model you intend to use. You can find your model ID and version number within the URL of the dataset version page, which is the page where you initiated training and viewed your results.\n\n3. **Test your model**: Once your model has completed the training process, you can put it to the test using the Roboflow Deploy page. Simply navigate to the Roboflow sidebar and click on \"Deploy.\" A box will appear, allowing you to run inference on images from your test set (i.e., images not used during training) to assess how your model performs on unseen data. Additionally, you can upload new images for further testing and evaluation.\n\n4. **Use the Roboflow Python SDK**: You can use the model in Python with the Roboflow Python SDK. To get started, first install the Roboflow Python package using pip:\n```python\npip install roboflow\n```\nNext, copy the code snippet at the bottom of the Deploy page on Roboflow Universe. This snippet will look something like this:\n```python\nfrom roboflow import Roboflow\n\nrf = Roboflow(api_key=\"\")\nproject = rf.workspace().project(\"barcodes-zmxjq\")\nmodel = project.version(4).model\n```\nRemember to replace `\"barcodes-zmxjq\"` with your project name and `4` with your model version.\n\nSources:\n- [How to Use a Free Computer Vision Barcode Detection API](https://blog.roboflow.com/read-barcodes-computer-vision#using-the-barcode-detection-api)\n- [Using Computer Vision for Online Exam Proctoring](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-online-exam-proctoring#where-can-you-find-the-model-id-and-version-of-a-model-you-train)\n- [How to Use Computer Vision for Environment Monitoring](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-environmental-impact-monitoring#testing-your-model-with-the-roboflow-deploy-page)\n- [How to Detect Metal Defects with Computer Vision](https://blog.roboflow.com/detect-metal-defects#step-1-create-a-roboflow-account)"

It is built on a simple publish-subscribe (pub/sub) model, which allows messages to be published to a queue and then sent as POST requests to a specific app endpoint (`/mndy-queue`). Each minor and major app version has its own queue.\n\nThe queue is useful for managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring that messages are processed in the order they were received. It provides two methods: `publishMessage` and `validateMessageSecret`.\n\nThe `publishMessage` method is used to publish a message to the queue. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Queue } from \"@mondaycom/apps-sdk\";\nconst queue = new Queue();\nconst messageContent = JSON.stringify({ content: \"This is a message\" })\nconst messageId = await queue.publishMessage(messageContent)\n```\n\nThe `validateMessageSecret` method is used to confirm whether a message is valid and that the request to the `/mndy-queue` endpoint was triggered by monday code. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```javascript\nconst queryParams = req.query;\nif (!queue.validateMessageSecret(queryParams.secret))  {\n  logger.info(\"Queue message received is not valid, since secret does not match. This message could come from an attacker.\");\n  throw new Error('not allowed')};\n}\n```\n\nAll messages will be sent to your app as HTTP POST requests at the `/mndy-queue` endpoint.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [monday.com apps SDK documentation](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/monday-code-sdk)."

      "answer": "To create a static site and an API and link them together using SST Ion, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Static Site**: You can create a static site using the `StaticSite` component in SST Ion. The `StaticSite` component takes a `name` and optional `args` and `opts` parameters. The `args` parameter can include a `path` which is the path to the directory where your static site is located. By default, this assumes your static site is in the root of your SST app. This directory will be uploaded to S3. The path is relative to your `sst.config.ts` file. Here is an example of how to create a static site:\n\n```javascript\nnew StaticSite(\"MyStaticSite\", { path: \"packages/web\" });\n```\n[Source](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/component/aws/static-site#constructor)\n\n2. **Create an API**: You can create an API using the `Router` component in SST Ion. The `Router` component takes a `name` and `args` parameter. The `args` parameter includes `routes` which is a map of routes to endpoints.

      "answer": "I'm an AI developed by Mapbox and I'm here to provide information based on the knowledge sources provided to me. However, I'm unable to provide a quote or schedule a call as it's beyond my capabilities. \n\nFor your project, Mapbox provides a variety of tools that can help you achieve your goals. You can build data-driven interactive visualizations layered on Mapbox basemaps for weather data like temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed, and more. You can also visualize this data on a 3D globe view or a 3D base map. Each map is customizable using Mapbox Studio, where you can design maps that provide a consistent and intuitive user experience while reflecting your company’s brand image [source](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/weather-industry-maps).\n\nFor additional map components, you can use geojson files to define shapes and assets. Mapbox supports the use of geojson for creating custom shapes and features on the map.\n\nTo get a quote for using Mapbox, I recommend reaching out to the Mapbox sales team directly. They will be able to provide you with detailed pricing information based on your specific needs and usage. You can contact them [here](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales/)."

      "answer": "The Temporal Web UI displays the Workers currently polling on the Workflow Task Queue with a count. If no Workers are polling, an error displays. If you see more Workers than expected, it could be due to multiple Worker Entities in a single Worker Process. Many SDKs support the ability to have multiple Worker Entities in a single Worker Process. A single Worker Entity can listen to only a single Task Queue. But if a Worker Process has multiple Worker Entities, the Worker Process could be listening to multiple Task Queues.\n\nAlso, note that the Temporal Cluster itself has internal workers for system Workflow Executions. However, these internal workers are not visible to the developer.\n\nIf you still see discrepancies, it might be a good idea to check your Worker Processes and their configurations. \n\nSources:\n- [Temporal Web UI > Recent Workflows > Workers](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui#workers)\n- [What is a Temporal Worker? > What is a Worker Process?

      "question": "where limit offset",
      "answer": "In Prisma, you can use the `skip` and `take` parameters to implement limit-offset pagination. The `skip` parameter allows you to skip a certain number of results, and the `take` parameter allows you to select a limited range of results.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use limit-offset pagination in Prisma:\n\n```ts\nconst results = await prisma.post.findMany({ skip: 200, take: 20, where: { email: { contains: 'Prisma', }, }, orderBy: { title: 'desc', },})\n```\n\nIn this example, the query skips the first 200 records and returns records 201 - 220.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that offset pagination does not scale well at the database level. For example, if you skip 200,000 records and take the first 10, the database still has to traverse the first 200,000 records before returning the 10 that you asked for, which can negatively affect performance.\n\nFor more information, you can check out the [Prisma documentation on pagination](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/pagination).\n\nSources:\n- [Prisma Blog](https://www.prisma.io/blog/fullstack-nextjs-graphql-prisma-2-fwpc6ds155#pagination-at-the-database-level)\n- [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/pagination#example-sorting-and-offset-pagination)"

      "question": "what audit log messages in repo 3 indicate that a user reset their user token?",
      "answer": "In Nexus Repository Manager 3, when a user resets their user token, it may not be directly logged in the audit log. However, you can look for changes in user activities in the `audit.log` file. This log file is updated each time a user or internal process modifies the configuration of Nexus Repository, as well as any asset and component additions and removals. Each line of this log contains an unformatted JSON message representing a single audit item. \n\nHere is an example of what an audit log entry might look like:\n\n```\n{  \n  \"timestamp\": \"2019-02-04 18:12:07,856-0500\",  \n  \"nodeId\": \"5DF0F434-88A6F4B7-AEDCE785-CAD9628C-8AD86154\",  \n  \"initiator\": \"admin/172.16.0.10\",  \n  \"domain\": \"security.user\",  \n  \"type\": \"modified\",  \n  \"context\": \"mynewusername\",  \n  \"thread\": \"quartz-7-thread-1\",  \n  \"attributes\": {  \n    \"id\": \"mynewusername\",  \n    \"name\": \"John Doe\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `type` field indicates a modification, which could potentially be a token reset. However, it's important to note that this log does not specifically indicate a user token reset. \n\nFor more specific logging, you may need to adjust your log levels or enable additional auditing capabilities. \n\nPlease refer to the [Sonatype documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/auditing) for more information on auditing in Nexus Repository Manager 3.\n\nSources: [Zendesk Ticket 82728](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/82728), [Zendesk Ticket 86535](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/86535)"

      "answer": "Based on the knowledge sources provided, the signal handler you've written seems to be valid in terms of syntax and structure. However, there are a few things to consider:\n\n1. The signal handler is asynchronous, which is allowed in Temporal. However, be aware that putting too much async logic inside of signal handlers can be confusing for readers and separate the logic quite a bit. Errors out of signal handlers suspend/fail workflows just like if they were thrown out of the main `run` method ([source](https://community.temporal.io/t/7628)).\n\n2. The signal handler is manipulating an instance attribute, presumably an `asyncio.Queue` (`self._pending_user_messages`). This is a common practice in Temporal workflows to push signals to and get them on the main `run` method, keeping logic close together ([source](https://community.temporal.io/t/7628)).\n\n3. The signal handler is not using the `dynamic=True` option in the `@workflow.signal` decorator, which means it's not a dynamic signal handler. Dynamic signal handlers in Temporal are invoked dynamically at runtime if no other signal with the same input is registered ([source](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/python/features#set-a-dynamic-signal)).\n\n4. There's no explicit error handling in the signal handler. As mentioned earlier, errors out of signal handlers suspend/fail workflows just like if they were thrown out of the main `run` method. It might be a good idea to add some error handling to your signal handler to manage potential issues.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness and correctness of your signal handler will also depend on the rest of your workflow code and the specific requirements of your application."

      "answer": "In VRChat, the term 'seated' is used in the context of stations, specifically the `VRCStation` component. The `seated` property is a boolean that indicates whether a station is one that the user should be sitting in. \n\nThe behavior of the `seated` property varies depending on the SDK version and the avatar version. \n\nFor example, in an SDK2 station with an SDK2 avatar, if `seated` is checked, the standard seated IK (Inverse Kinematics) is applied to SDK2 avatars. This locks the hip and lower body into place, and the head/hands are tracked. If `seated` is unchecked, the SDK2 avatar plays the animation with no IK applied.\n\nIn an SDK2 station with an SDK3 avatar, the animation in the station will automatically have Tracking Control applied based on the `seated` property of the station. If `seated` is checked, a Temporary Pose Space is applied to adjust the viewpoint.\n\nIn an SDK3 station with either an SDK2 or SDK3 avatar, the `seated` property does not necessarily indicate the tracking type on SDK3 avatars. The creator decides what type of Tracking Control to apply.\n\nIn terms of code, the `seated` property is a part of the `VRCStation` class in the VRChat API. Here's how it's defined:\n\n```csharp\nbool seated { get; set; }\n```\n\nThe default value of `seated` is `true`. You can use it to determine whether a user should be sitting in a station or not.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following sources:\n- [VRC Station - Creator Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/components/vrc_station)\n- [VRCStation Class - UdonSharp Documentation](https://udonsharp.docs.vrchat.com/vrchat-api#vrcstation)"

However, if you're encountering a timeout error after installing Portainer, it might be due to not completing the initial setup within 5 minutes of starting the Portainer container for the first time. This is a security measure to prevent a malicious user from taking over a fresh Portainer installation. \n\nTo resolve this, you can try stopping and restarting the Portainer container. This will give you another 5 minutes to complete the initial setup. Also, ensure your `portainer_data` volume is correctly mounted to the Portainer container and that it contains your Portainer configuration files. If your `portainer_data` volume is not mounted correctly or the configuration files are missing, Portainer assumes you are performing a fresh installation and will act accordingly.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to this [knowledge base article](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/your-portainer-instance-has-timed-out-for-security-purposes)."

      "question": "should I limit max direct memory the JVM allocates for IQ Server?",
      "answer": "Yes, it is recommended to limit the maximum direct memory that the JVM allocates for the IQ Server. This can be done by setting the `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` parameter in your Java startup arguments. The specific value you should set depends on your system's resources and the requirements of your applications.\n\nFor example, if your system has 16GB of RAM, you might set your maximum heap size (`-Xmx`) to 8GB, which is half of your total RAM. This is a common recommendation for initial deployments. If you're using the G1GC garbage collection algorithm (recommended for heap sizes of 8GB and larger), your startup command might look something like this:\n\n```bash\njava -Xmx8g -XX:+UseG1GC ...\n```\n\nHowever, if you're running Nexus Repository Manager, the recommended settings might be different. For a system with 8 CPU cores and 16GB of RAM, the suggested settings are:\n\n```bash\n-Xms4G  \n-Xmx4G  \n-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=6717M\n```\n\nRemember, these are just examples. The optimal settings for your system can depend on many factors, including the number of applications you're running, the number of repositories, and other system loads.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [System Requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/product-information/system-requirements#SystemRequirements-cpu-ramCPUandRAM) and [Sonatype Nexus Repository System Requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/sonatype-nexus-repository-system-requirements#SonatypeNexusRepositorySystemRequirements-ExampleMaximumMemoryConfigurations) documentation."

However, you need to provide some other properties that can be used to identify the VPC.

On your frontend, you would then make a request to this API route, and use the response data as needed.\n\nHere's a very basic example:\n\n```javascript\n// In your API route (e.g., route.ts)\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  // ... your LangChain function call here, result stored in `output`\n  res.status(200).json({ data: output });\n}\n\n// On your frontend\nconst fetchData = async () => {\n  const res = await fetch('/api/route');\n  const data = await res.json();\n  // ... use `data` as needed\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary based on your specific use case and setup.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you might find the [Next.js documentation on API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) helpful. For more information on how to use LangChain in a Next.js project, you can check out the [official Next.js starter template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template) provided in the [LangChain Deployment Guide](https://js.langchain.com/docs/guides/deployment/nextjs)."

      "answer": "Mixpanel provides several ways to manage changes in event names without losing historical data:\n\n1. **Rename an Event within a Report**: You can rename an event within a specific report by clicking on the \"three dots\" icon beside an event and selecting \"Rename\". This will only affect the current report and will not change the event's name in other reports. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/insights)\n\n2. **Use Mixpanel Lexicon**: Mixpanel Lexicon provides a means for you to change an event's or property's display name on the UI, making it more user-friendly. This does not affect the underlying data. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties)\n\n3. **Merging Events**: If you have events that serve the same function but have different names (for example, due to being sent from different platforms), you can merge these events into a single event in Lexicon. This way, Mixpanel will recognize both events as a unique event, streamlining your implementation and simplifying report analysis. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-governance/lexicon)\n\nRemember, it's important to have a consistent naming convention for your events and properties. Mixpanel recommends adopting snake_case for your event and property names, and using the (Object) (Verb) format for event names. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties)\n\nIf you need to backfill historical data due to changes in event names, Mixpanel provides several methods for importing data, such as using a data warehouse connector or the Import API.

      "question": "sharding",
      "answer": "Sharding is a method used to scale databases by splitting them into multiple separate databases, each with its own writable primary node. This is not unique to scaling out; it's common to shard data even in scale-up scenarios, as splitting data can help reduce index growth and reduce write locking on a single instance. For the vast majority of PostgreSQL users, sharding is the only way to achieve a writeable scale-out database [[source](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/the-true-cost-of-a-cloud-database/)].\n\nHowever, manual sharding comes with its own set of challenges. It requires significant development effort in the application itself to handle tasks such as designing a table-sharding or partitioning model, developing application logic to route data to the correct shard or partition, and handling failure scenarios where some shards or partitions are not available [[source](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/the-true-cost-of-a-cloud-database/)].\n\nCockroachDB addresses these challenges by automatically sharding data as part of its distributed database architecture. It uses a feature called hash-sharded indexes to distribute sequential data across multiple nodes within your cluster, eliminating hotspots. This is done using a virtual computed column, known as a shard column, to control the distribution of values across the index [[source](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/hash-sharded-indexes#overview)]. \n\nCockroachDB also allows for easy scaling by spinning up nodes and letting the database handle data rebalancing. It enables resharding while in production without downtime or data loss [[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4LpUYF6yes)]. \n\nIn summary, while sharding is a common method for scaling databases, it can introduce complexity and development overhead. CockroachDB offers automated sharding as part of its distributed architecture, simplifying the scaling process."

      "answer": "The requirement of a client secret for authentication in FusionAuth depends on the specific endpoint and the client authentication policy. \n\nFor example, in the OAuth endpoints, the client secret is required in some cases and not in others. The client secret is used by confidential OAuth clients to authenticate with FusionAuth during one of the OAuth grants, such as the authorization code grant or the client credentials grant. They are also used to sign OIDC `id_token`s.\n\nHere are some scenarios:\n\n- For the Authorization Code Grant, if the clientAuthenticationPolicy value is `Required`, the client secret is required. If the value is `NotRequired`, the client secret is not required. If the value is `NotRequiredWhenUsingPKCE` and PKCE is used, the client secret is not required. If PKCE is not used, the client secret is required.\n- For the Implicit Grant, the client secret is not applicable.\n- For the Password Credentials Grant and Refresh Token Grant, the requirement of the client secret follows the same rules as the Authorization Code Grant.\n\nEven when the client secret is not required, if it is provided it will be validated. Prior to version `1.28.0`, whether the client secret was required was controlled by the oauthConfiguration.requireClientAuthentication value of the application object. For versions `1.28.0` or later, use oauthConfiguration.clientAuthenticationPolicy to configure this functionality.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [FusionAuth documentation on OAuth endpoints](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#client-secret)."

However, there are some general tips to improve your no-code app's performance. \n\nOne of the tips is to avoid over-fetching data, which can significantly impact your app's performance. When your app fetches too much data, it takes longer to load, negatively impacting the user experience. To avoid over-fetching, it's important to use pagination to limit the amount of data fetched in a single request. Most no-code platforms, including Toddle, support pagination, making it easy to limit the amount of data fetched and improve your app's performance [source](https://toddle.dev/blog/seven-tips-to-improve-your-no-code-app).\n\nIn terms of managing the number of DOM elements (like divs), having a large DOM can indeed affect performance, but it's typically not a huge concern unless you're using them very liberally or being very inefficient with your build. Toddle keeps a fairly clean HTML output overall, so it likely won't be a concern for most [source](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1175303243669196912).\n\nFor more specific guidance on managing scroll events in Toddle, I would recommend reaching out to Toddle's support or community forums."

      "question": "page note found",
      "answer": "If you're encountering a \"Page Not Found\" error on your Netlify site, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some common causes and their solutions:\n\n1. **Incorrect publish directory**: If you're deploying your site directly, without any build step, and you've placed all your files inside a sub-folder in your git repo, you might encounter a 404 error. This is because when connecting the site to Netlify, the responsibility of configuring the correct settings is left to the user. If you don't configure the publish directory, you'll see a 404 error because the files actually live inside `https://your-site.netlify.app/sub-folder`. To fix this, either move all your files outside the sub-folder or change the publish directory in Netlify Site settings[^1^].\n\n2. **SPA redirect rule missing**: If you're using tools like Create React App, Vite, Angular, etc. to create Single-Page Applications (SPAs), these applications don't have an HTML page per path but instead rely on JavaScript to handle the navigation. For such apps, it's important to have the following contents in your `_redirects` file[^1^]:\n    ```\n    /* /index.html 200\n    ```\n\n3. **Geographic area or IP address is blocked**: If your geographic area or IP address is blocked from a site, you will only see a Netlify-branded 404 page[^1^].\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, you can check the `x-nf-request-id` header which Netlify sends with every HTTP response. This can help track the HTTP response with the issue[^2^].\n\nFor more troubleshooting help, you can check out the [Support Forums guide on unexpected 404 page errors](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-i-ve-deployed-my-site-but-i-still-see-page-not-found/125)[^1^].\n\n[^1^]: [Support Guide: I’ve deployed my site but I still see \"Page not found”](https://answers.netlify.com/t/125)\n[^2^]: [Forum Post: [Support Guide] I’ve deployed my site but I still see \"Page not found” > Answers Part 1](https://answers.netlify.com/t/125)"

      "answer": "To set the `client_credentials_grant_access_token_lifespan` via HTTP, you can use the `setOAuth2ClientLifespans` method of the Ory API. This method allows you to set the lifespans of different token types issued for a specific OAuth 2.0 client.\n\nThe endpoint for this operation is `PUT /admin/clients/{id}/lifespans`, where `{id}` should be replaced with the OAuth 2.0 Client ID.\n\nThe request body should be a JSON object with the properties of the different token types and their lifespans. For `client_credentials_grant_access_token_lifespan`, you can specify a time duration in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours.\n\nHere is an example of how the request body might look:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"client_credentials_grant_access_token_lifespan\": \"1h\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the lifespan of the access token for the client credentials grant is set to 1 hour.\n\nPlease note that to perform this operation, you must be authenticated by means of one of the following methods: `oryAccessToken`.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Ory API Reference](https://www.ory.sh/docs/reference/api).\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation might vary depending on the programming language and the HTTP client library you are using."

      "question": "how do i hide div when below 960px viewport",
      "answer": "To hide a div when the viewport is below 960px in Toddle, you can use conditional styling and the show/hide formula. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Create a conditional style for your div. In the styles section, click on the \"-\" button to add a new conditional style. Set the condition for this style to apply when the viewport width is below 960px. You can learn more about conditional styles in the [Toddle documentation](https://toddle.dev/docs/conditional-styles).\n\n2. Use the show/hide formula to hide the div when the condition is met. The show/hide formula is based on a boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the element is shown; if it evaluates to false, the element is hidden. In this case, you want the div to be hidden when the viewport width is below 960px, so you would set the show/hide formula to evaluate to false when the viewport width is below 960px. You can learn more about the show/hide formula in the [Toddle documentation](https://toddle.dev/docs/show-hide-formula).\n\nRemember, an element will be completely removed and unmounted when its condition is set to false. This means that APIs, onLoad, and creating all the DOM nodes will run again when the condition is true, once again. Doing this continuously can lead to poor performance. Instead, in rare cases, you can instead hide an element with `display: none` to still push it to the DOM, but not render it, or `visibility: hidden` to render the element, but not show it.\n\nPlease note that this is a general guide and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific use case and the structure of your Toddle project."

      "answer": "Prisma is a powerful tool for integrating with Next.js, a React-based framework, to handle database operations in an efficient and intuitive way. Here are some key steps to integrate Prisma with a Next.js application:\n\n1. **Install Prisma CLI and Prisma Client**: These are necessary dependencies for integrating Prisma into a Next.js application.\n\n2. **Initialize Prisma**: This sets up Prisma in your project.\n\n3. **Create a Prisma Schema**: This file is used to define your database models.\n\n4. **Run Migrations**: This creates the necessary tables in your database.\n\n5. **Use Prisma Client**: This is used to interact with your database. You can use it in the `getServerSideProps` function to fetch data from the database and render it in your application. You can also use it in an API route to save data to the database.\n\n6. **Use Prisma Studio**: This is a visual interface for viewing and editing data in your database.\n\nIn addition to these steps, Prisma also supports TypeScript and provides type-safe data access, which can be particularly useful in Next.js applications. Prisma can be used at build time (`getStaticProps`), at request time (`getServerSideProps`), or using API routes to expose a REST or GraphQL API.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to these resources:\n- [Prisma - The Easiest Way to Work with a Database in Next.js (UPDATED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMnlyi60avU)\n- [Getting Started with Next.js and Prisma - Ryan Chenkie, Lee Robinson | Prisma Day 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDK-7-aSY0)\n- [Prisma - The Easiest Way to Work with a Database in Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF8DV_ICIpY)\n- [Building a Fullstack app using NextJS and Prisma - CityJS Conf 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aim8Mk-ETK0)\n- [Building Serverless Apps With Next.Js And Prisma - Hassan El Mghari - Prisma Serverless Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mg2zD_DaOU)\n- [Jamstack with Next.js and Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/blog/jamstack-with-nextjs-prisma-jamstackN3XT#jamstack-with-nextjs-and-prisma)\n- [Fullstack App With TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Prisma & GraphQL: GraphQL API Part 3](https://www.prisma.io/blog/fullstack-nextjs-graphql-prisma-2-fwpc6ds155)\n- [Fullstack App With TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Prisma & GraphQL: Authentication Part 1](https://www.prisma.io/blog/fullstack-nextjs-graphql-prisma-3-clxbrcqppv)"

      "answer": "The HTTP 500 error you're encountering indicates an internal server error. This is a general error that suggests something went wrong on the server's end. It's not necessarily related to your `create_item` mutation. However, there are a few things you could check:\n\n1. **Invalid arguments**: Ensure that the board or item IDs you're using exist and are valid.\n2. **Malformatted JSON column values**: When using the `create_item` mutation, make sure your JSON column values are correctly formatted. \n\nHere's an example of a `create_item` mutation:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n create_item (board_id: 1234567890, group_id: \"group_one\", item_name: \"new item\", column_values: \"{\\\"date\\\":\\\"2023-05-25\\\"}\") {\n id\n }\n}\n```\n\nIn this mutation, `board_id` is the ID of the board where you want to create the item, `group_id` is the ID of the group within the board where the item will be created, `item_name` is the name of the new item, and `column_values` is a JSON-formatted string that specifies the values for the item's columns.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues after checking these points, it might be a good idea to reach out to the monday.com team for further assistance.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [monday.com API documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/errors).\n\nPlease note that you should not create more than 10 to 20 items in real time. Each `create_item` mutation uses 10,000 complexity points, which means you can make ~160 items per minute to avoid hitting the complexity limit. If you need to create more items, you'll need to queue your mutations.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [monday.com development best practices](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/development-best-practices)."

If you prefer to write code, you can use UdonSharp, which allows you to write Udon in a way very similar to C#. However, the documentation does not provide a direct method to convert or transfer code from the Udon Node Graph to a U# script or C# script. You would likely need to manually rewrite the logic from your Udon Node Graph in U# or C#.\n\nFor creating a new U# script, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make a new object in your scene\n2. Add an Udon Behaviour component to your object\n3. Below the \"New Program\" button click the dropdown and select \"Udon C# Program Asset\"\n4. Now click the New Program button, this will create a new UdonSharp program asset for you\n5. Click the Create Script button and choose a save destination and name for the script.\n6. This will create a template script that's ready for you to start working on, open the script in your editor of choice and start programming\n\nYou can also create assets from the UdonBehaviour in your project asset explorer:\n\n1. Right-click in your project asset explorer\n2. Navigate to Create > U# script\n3. Click U# script, this will open a create file dialog\n4. Choose a name for your script and click Save\n5.

      "answer": "To get more performance from your AtlasOS without overclocking or upgrading your hardware, you can try the following methods:\n\n1. Tweaking settings in the Atlas folder: Some users have reported performance improvements by adjusting settings in the Atlas folder. However, be careful as incorrect settings can lead to performance loss.\n\n2. Adjusting Affinities: You can try to adjust the affinities of your processes. This can potentially improve performance, but be careful as it can also lead to performance loss if not done correctly.\n\n3. Using game-util: This utility includes features like Timer res, Mem cleaner plus with a shortcut key, Disable/enable idle, and Kill explorer/dwm. These configurations might help to achieve a slight improvement in performance.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on your specific hardware and software configurations.

      "question": "What is superfluid module",
      "answer": "The Superfluid module is a part of the Osmosis protocol that provides a mechanism for Superfluid Staking. This feature enhances the security of the consensus layer through a concept called \"Proof of Useful Stake\". In this system, each participant receives an amount of OSMO tokens that represents the value of their share of liquidity pool tokens staked and delegated to validators. This results in the security guarantee of the consensus layer being based on GAMM LP shares.\n\nThe Superfluid module involves several methods and processes:\n\n- The `SuperfluidDelegate` method stores your share of bonded liquidity pool tokens, with `validateLock` as a verifier for lockup time.\n- `GetSuperfluidOsmo` mints OSMO tokens each day for delegation as a representative of the value of your pool share. This amount is burned each day and re-minted to keep the representative amount of the value of your pool share accurate.\n- `GetExpectedDelegationAmount` iterates over each (denom, delegate) pair and checks for how much OSMO we have delegated. The difference from the current balance to what is expected is burned / minted to match with the expected.\n- A `messageServer` method executes the Superfluid delegate message.\n- `syntheticLockup` is used to index bond holders and tracking their addresses for reward distribution or potentially slashing purposes.\n- An `IntermediaryAccount` is mostly used for the actual reward distribution or slashing events, and are responsible for establishing the connection between each superfluid staked lock and their delegation to the validator.\n\nRewards are distributed per epoch, which is currently a day. The OSMO token is minted and burned in the context of Superfluid Staking, and throughout all of this, OSMO's supply is preserved in queries to the bank module.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Superfluid module specifications](https://docs.osmosis.zone/osmosis-core/modules/superfluid) and the [Osmosis GitHub repository](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/superfluid).\n\nSources:\n- [Osmosis Documentation](https://docs.osmosis.zone/osmosis-core/modules/superfluid#abstract)\n- [Osmosis GitHub](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/superfluid/README.md)"

      "answer": "RudderStack primarily uses first-party cookies for its operations, so the move by Google (and other browsers) to phase out third-party cookies should not directly impact how you collect and send data through RudderStack. This is confirmed by a [community discussion](https://slack.com/archives/C01E4PLB135/p1705440402919159) where it was clarified that RudderStack uses first-party cookies and the blocking of third-party cookies by Google Chrome or other browsers should not affect its functionality.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that ad-blockers have become more sophisticated and can sometimes block RudderStack and similar vendor code. To mitigate this, RudderStack supports the use of custom domains which can reduce the chances of getting ad-blocked.\n\nMoreover, RudderStack has introduced a [cookieless tracking feature](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/releases/fall23-roundup#cookieless-tracking) as part of its JavaScript SDK. This feature gives you control over what user information you collect and where to store it, allowing you to adapt to fast-changing regulatory environments. You can store data in browser cookies or use one of four cookieless storage methods: local storage, in-memory storage, session storage, or none.\n\nSo, while the industry's shift away from third-party cookies is a significant change, RudderStack has features and capabilities in place to help you navigate this transition."

      "answer": "When you partition a PDF using the Unstructured library, the output is a list of document `Element` objects. These element objects represent different components of the source document. Currently, the `unstructured` library supports the following element types:\n\n- `FigureCaption`\n- `NarrativeText`\n- `ListItem`\n- `Title`\n- `Address`\n- `Table`\n- `PageBreak`\n- `Header`\n- `Footer`\n- `UncategorizedText`\n- `Image`\n- `Formula`\n\nEach element also has an `element_id`, `metadata`, and `text`. The `metadata` can be further explored on the [Metadata page](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/metadata.html#metadata-label).\n\nHere is an example of how you can print the elements:\n\n```python\nelements = partition(filename=\"example-10k.html\")\n\nfor element in elements[:5]:\n    print(element)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n```\n\nYou can also filter the elements based on your needs. For example, if you’re training a summarization model you may only want to include narrative text for model training. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.documents.elements import NarrativeText\nfrom unstructured.partition.text_type import sentence_count\n\nfor element in elements[:100]:\n    if isinstance(element, NarrativeText) and sentence_count(element.text) > 2:\n        print(element)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n```\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Unstructured Introduction](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/introduction/overview.html)."

      "answer": "To auto-fill the `<Edit>` form with the current values of the record in Refine, you need to use the `useForm` hook with `action: \"edit\"`. This action fetches the record data according to the `id` with `useOne` and returns the `queryResult` for you to fill the form. After the form is submitted, it updates the record with `useUpdate`.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `useForm` with `action: \"edit\"`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";  \nimport { Edit, useForm } from \"@refinedev/antd\";  \nimport { Form, Input } from \"antd\";  \n\ninterface IPost {  \n id: number;  \n title: string;  \n content: string;  \n}  \n\nconst PostEditPage: React.FC = () => {  \n const { formProps, saveButtonProps } = useForm<IPost>();  \n\n return (  \n <Edit saveButtonProps={saveButtonProps}>  \n <Form {...formProps} layout=\"vertical\">  \n <Form.Item  \n label=\"Title\"  \n name=\"title\"  \n rules={[  \n {  \n required: true,  \n },  \n ]}  \n >  \n <Input />  \n </Form.Item>  \n <Form.Item  \n label=\"Content\"  \n name=\"content\"  \n rules={[  \n {  \n required: true,  \n },  \n ]}  \n >  \n <Input.TextArea />  \n </Form.Item>  \n </Form>  \n </Edit>  \n );  \n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useForm` hook is used to manage the form state. The `formProps` returned by `useForm` are spread into the `Form` component to bind it to the form state. The `saveButtonProps` are passed to the `Edit` component to handle the form submission.\n\nThe `useForm` hook requires the `id` of the record to edit. By default, it uses the `id` from the route, but this can be changed with the `setId` function or `id` property.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-form#action)."

      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project depends on several factors such as the nature of your project, the specific requirements of your application, and the constraints of your hardware. Here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Understand the nature of your project**: Different projects have different requirements. For example, if your project involves a home automation system, you might need a protocol that supports mesh networking, such as Zigbee or Thread. If your project involves connecting to a cloud platform, you might need a protocol that supports IP connectivity, such as MQTT or AMQP.\n\n2. **Consider the requirements of your application**: Some applications require high data rates, while others require low power consumption. For example, Wi-Fi is great for high data rates but consumes a lot of power, making it unsuitable for battery-powered applications. On the other hand, Bluetooth Smart is ideal for connecting point solutions to smartphones and for bulk data transfers on battery-powered devices[^1^].\n\n3. **Consider the constraints of your hardware**: Some protocols might not be supported by your hardware. For example, if you're using a Silicon Labs device, you might want to use a protocol that is supported by the Silicon Labs framework[^2^].\n\n4. **Evaluate after installation**: Once you've chosen a protocol and implemented it, you should evaluate the system to ensure it meets your requirements[^3^].\n\n5. **Consider security aspects**: Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation[^2^].\n\n6. **Consider multiprotocol implementation**: Implementing more than one protocol on a single device allows for cost savings, space savings, and energy savings[^4^].\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol can greatly affect the performance and functionality of your IoT project, so it's important to make an informed decision.\n\n[^1^]: [Thread Ushering in Era of Connectivity](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Thread-Ushering-in-Era-of-Connectivity.pdf)\n[^2^]: [UG103.03: Fundamentals of Design Choices](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)\n[^3^]: [Unify Framework Getting Started](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/UnifySDK/blob/main/doc/getting_started_unify_sdk.md)\n[^4^]: [UG103.16: Multiprotocol Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf)"

To resolve a procedure, a user must have at least the `USAGE` privilege on the schema of the procedure. To call a procedure, a user must have `EXECUTE` privilege on the procedure. At procedure definition and execution time, a user must have privileges on all the objects referenced in the procedure body. Privileges on referenced objects can be revoked and later procedure calls can fail due to lack of permission.\n\nIf you grant `EXECUTE` privilege as a default privilege at the database level, newly created procedures inherit that privilege from the database.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [CockroachDB documentation on CREATE PROCEDURE](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/create-procedure).\n\nPlease note that as of the time of writing, CockroachDB does not fully support stored procedures.

      "question": "How much reward will service provider get?",
      "answer": "The rewards that a service provider on the Lava network receives are calculated based on several factors and mechanisms. Here are the key components:\n\n1. **Provider Rewards**: After staking on the chain, providers serve consumers and get cryptographic proofs of relay service. These proofs are submitted on chain to accumulate CUs that lead to token rewards. The calculation for provider rewards is complex and contingent on the validity of submitted proofs. However, given valid proofs, rewards are mostly affected by 3 factors: Passable Quality of Service, Quality of Service Excellence, and Jail. [Source](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-improve-service#-earning-rewards)\n\n2. **Providers Payment**: Providers receive payments once a month. These payments are funded by the funds that consumers paid for their subscriptions. The amount of coins to be sent to each provider depends on the number of tracked CUs they had over the previous month. The payment is calculated using the following formula:\n```math\nPayment = subscription\\_price * \\frac{provider\\_tracked\\_CU}{total\\_CU\\_used\\_by\\_subscription}\n```\n[Source](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/main/x/pairing/README.md)\n\n3. **Payment Distribution**: The reward distribution in the ipRPC campaign is divided into two key components: “Participation” and “Service.” 90% of the pool is distributed monthly based on the services provided by each participating provider. 10% of the pool is dedicated monthly to the top 3 providers who have made contributions to help amplify Lava & Axelar or Lava & Evmos. [Source](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog/providers-guide-to-axelar-iprpc), [Source](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog/providers-guide-to-evmos-iprpc)\n\n4. **Providers Rewards Pool**: Providers get rewards for their services from the funds used to buy subscriptions. Besides these rewards, the provider also get monthly bonus rewards from a pre-allocated rewards pools. The total monthly bonus rewards (\"total spec payout\") are calculated per spec by a specific formula. [Source](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/main/x/rewards/README.md)\n\n5. **Claiming Rewards**: Providers retain the latest relay request locally, containing a cryptographic signature from the consumer, developer, or subscription key as evidence. At the conclusion of an epoch, after a delay, these accrued rewards aggregate into a transaction named 'relay_payment,' automatically initiated by the provider service. [Source](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/main/x/README.md)\n\n6. **Incubation Program**: Participants of ipRPC are part of the Incubation program. They receive 50,000,000,000 uLava, which is equal to the maximum stake you are allowed to have on your Evmos provider. [Source](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog/providers-guide-to-evmos-iprpc)\n\nPlease note that the exact amount of rewards a provider will receive can vary based on these factors and the specific circumstances of their service provision."

Here is an example using `curl`:\n\n```bash\ncurl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \\\n--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n \"loginId\": \"teller@example.com\",\n \"password\": \"password\",\n \"applicationId\": \"e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e\"\n}'\n```\n\nThe response will contain a `token` field which is your access token.\n\n2. If you are using the Authorization Code Grant, after the user has logged in, the OAuth server will redirect the browser back to the application with a few parameters added to the URL. One of these parameters is `code`, which is the authorization code that you'll exchange for tokens. \n\n3.

      "answer": "You can use the `Map` function in Toddle to transform an array of objects to another array of objects. The `Map` function passes each item of an array through a mapping formula. The output is a new array containing all the values returned from passing each array item through the mapping formula.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can use the `Map` function:\n\n1. First, you need to select the `Map` function in the formula editor.\n2. Then, you need to provide the array you want to transform as the input.\n3. Next, you need to define the mapping formula. This formula will be applied to each item in the array. You can access each item using the `item` keyword.\n\nFor example, if you have an array of objects like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"name\": \"John\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Jane\" },\n  { \"name\": \"John\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Doe\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Jane\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Doe\" }\n]\n```\n\nAnd you want to transform it to:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"name\": 'John', \"count\": 2 },\n  { \"name\": 'Jane', \"count\": 2 },\n  { \"name\": 'Doe', \"count\": 2 }\n]\n```\n\nYou can use the `Map` function to iterate over the array and create a new object for each item. However, counting the number of occurrences of each name would require additional logic that is not directly provided by the `Map` function.\n\nFor more complex transformations, you might need to use other functions in combination with `Map`, such as `Filter`, `Reduce`, `Split`, `Get`, and `Set`.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Toddle documentation on the Map function](https://toddle.dev/docs/formulas/reference#%40toddle%2Fmap) and the [Discord support threads](https://discord.com/channels/972416966683926538/1198902189981171772) where similar questions have been discussed."

We'd like to minimize the latency of the returned state info..\n\nWhen the PTX sends a packet that requires an ack payload, we see that actual data from the PRX in the following transaction.\n\nThis is because the PRX is queuing the response on reception of the message from the PTX, and this means that the data from the PRX is one cycle old.\n\nIs there a way to write the state info to the ack payload in the same cycle?\n\nThe worst-case data size for the PRX state is 90 bytes.\n\nOr, is there another approach?",
      "answer": "In the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) protocol, a packet transaction is initiated by a packet transmission from the PTX and is successfully completed when the PTX has received an acknowledgment packet (ACK packet) from the PRX. The PRX is allowed to attach a data payload to the ACK packet. To do so, the PRX adds a packet to its TX FIFO, which is sent as the payload in the next ACK packet. If the PTX does not receive the ACK after the initial transmitted packet, it attempts to retransmit the packet until the ACK is finally received. The maximum number of allowed retransmission attempts and the delay between each attempt is specified by the most recent call to either `esb_init()` or the functions `esb_set_retransmit_count()` and `esb_set_retransmit_delay()`[^1^].\n\nHowever, the ESB protocol does not support sending the ACK payload in the same cycle. The PRX prepares the ACK payload after receiving the packet from the PTX, and it is sent in the next transaction[^1^]. This is why you see the data from the PRX in the following transaction.\n\nAs for your requirement of sending 90 bytes of data, please note that the maximum payload size for ESB is 32 bytes[^2^]. If you need to send more data, you would have to split it across multiple packets.\n\nIf minimizing latency is your primary concern, you might want to consider adjusting the retransmission delay and count, as well as optimizing your data handling to ensure that the PRX is ready to send the ACK payload as soon as it receives the packet from the PTX.\n\n[^1^]: [nRF Connect SDK > Bundle > Ncs-latest > Page > Nrf > Protocols > Esb > Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) > Packet transaction Part 1](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/protocols/esb/index.html#packet_transaction)\n[^2^]: [nRF Connect SDK > Bundle > Ncs-latest > Page > Nrf > Protocols > Esb > Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) > Packet identification](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/protocols/esb/index.html#packet_identification)"

      "question": "What should I expect from Avalanche dApps?",
      "answer": "Decentralized applications (dApps) on Avalanche offer a range of features and benefits. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Avalanche dApps are programs where there is no single authority that maintains the state and processes transactions. This means that many independent validators maintain the blockchain, which holds its state, and processes transactions, ensuring a high level of decentralization and security [source](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4587146-what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp).\n\n2. **Customization**: Unlike legacy blockchain networks, Avalanche allows you to launch a dApp defined by a Virtual Machine. Each dApp runs on its own independent blockchain, validated by a Subnet, a dynamic, custom set of validators. This allows for the creation of private blockchains [source](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4587339-what-is-the-history-of-blockchain#h_a89ed41e64).\n\n3. **Performance**: Avalanche is very performant. It can process thousands of transactions per second with one to two-second acceptance latency. This makes Avalanche suitable for real-time payments [source](https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche/avalanche-consensus#why-do-we-care).\n\n4. **Interoperability**: With AvalancheJS, a JavaScript library for building dApps on Avalanche, developers can interact with various APIs, manage private keys, retrieve balances on addresses, build and sign transactions, issue signed transactions to the X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain on the Primary network, and more [source](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6159048-what-is-avalanche-js).\n\n5. **Support**: If you encounter any issues or have questions while using Avalanche dApps, you can reach out to the Avalanche team on their public Discord server [source](https://docs.avax.network/build/dapp/launch-dapp#support).\n\nRemember, Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second. Its novel consensus protocol, Subnet infrastructure, and HyperSDK toolkit enable Web3 developers to easily launch powerful, custom blockchain solutions [source](https://www.avax.network/blog/teleporter-makes-avalanche-a-fully-interoperable-l0-network)."

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project involves considering several factors, including the specific requirements of your project and the features offered by different protocols. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Wireless Technology**: Silicon Labs offers various wireless technologies, each with its own strengths and suitable use cases. For instance, Zigbee is known for its mesh networking capabilities, making it ideal for applications where devices need to communicate with each other over short to medium distances. It's also self-healing and can adapt its routing as link quality changes or nodes move. Zigbee is particularly suitable for low-power networks, monitoring, and control applications in homes, commercial buildings, and industrial plants. \n\n2. **Hardware Design**: You need to decide whether to use a System-on-Chip (SoC) design or a Network CoProcessor (NCP) design. An SoC design integrates all components of a computer or other system into a single chip. It may offer advantages in terms of compactness and power efficiency. An NCP design, on the other hand, uses a separate processor for handling network communications, which can offer advantages in terms of flexibility and scalability.\n\n3. **Security**: Security is a crucial aspect of any IoT project. You need to consider what security models will be used in your project. For instance, Zigbee offers improved security features, including Trust-Centre link keys.\n\n4. **Routing and Network Management**: Consider what kind of routing optimizations to employ in the network and how to deliver messages through the network. For instance, in a Zigbee network, messages can travel up to 30 hops, and source-routing can be used for improved point to multipoint message transmission.\n\n5. **Development Environment**: Consider the development environment that you are comfortable with or that meets your project requirements. For instance, Silicon Labs offers the Simplicity Studio development environment, which supports their chips and networking stacks such as EmberZNet PRO.\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol will significantly impact the design and performance of your IoT project, so it's essential to make an informed decision. \n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the Silicon Labs' [Fundamentals series](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-02-fundamentals-zigbee.pdf) and [Design Choices guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)."

      "question": "what are releases",
      "answer": "In CircleCI, a *release* is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services. A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed. \n\nIn the releases dashboard, releases are tagged as **Progressive** if they refer to an Argo Rollout. A release starts when the component version is updated, and ends when the new version has reached 100% availability, and all associated validations have been completed. In the case of a progressive release, this happens when the Rollout completes. In the case of a Deployment, this happens when the Deployment replicas are all available and ready.\n\nCircleCI releases give you visibility into your Kubernetes deployments within the CircleCI web app, as well as access to commands and visualisations for release management. From the CircleCI web app, you can restore version, scale component, restart component, retry release, promote release, and cancel release.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Releases Overview](https://circleci.com/docs/release/releases-overview) in the CircleCI documentation."

      "answer": "Sonatype's Nexus Repository Manager (NXRM) provides several features to help administrators manage and clean up repositories. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Multi-policy Cleanup**: NXRM admins can use regular expressions to clean up a given repository by team and/or project. They can apply multiple cleanup policies for an individual repository, which can be used for longer retention of a certain set of artifacts [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/2019-release-notes.html)].\n\n2. **Cleanup Task**: When you start a server with cleanup abilities enabled, Nexus Repository automatically creates a task named *Cleanup service*. By default, this task is scheduled to run daily at 1AM server time. This task executes cleanup of all repositories that have a policy other than *None* set [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/cleanup-policies.html)].\n\n3. **Cleanup Preview Experience**: For Sonatype Nexus Repository Pro deployments using a PostgreSQL database, admin users can download a CSV report showing what a selected cleanup policy would remove if it were run as currently configured [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-nexus-repository-3-62-0-release-notes.html), [source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/cleanup-policies.html)].\n\n4. **SQL-based Cleanup**: As of release 3.65.0, all Sonatype Nexus Repository Pro instances using PostgreSQL databases will use SQL-based cleanup by default. SQL-based cleanup is proven to take considerably less time than Java-based cleanup [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/cleanup-policies.html)].\n\n5. **Cleanup Policies for Specific Formats**: When creating cleanup policies for specific formats like Yum, you can use the Asset Name Matcher criteria. This allows you to remove components that have at least one asset name matching a regular expression pattern [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/nexus-repository-3-38-0---3-38-1-release-notes.html)].\n\n6. **Retain Select Versions**: For Maven and Docker, you also have the option to exclude the latest \"x\" number of versions from your cleanup policy. Sonatype Nexus Repository will use the version number (for Maven) or component age (for Docker) to determine what to keep [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/cleanup-policies.html)].\n\nRemember, planning for cleanup is a Nexus administrator’s top priority. The number of artifacts moving into the repository will need to be matched by the artifacts being cleaned. This is critical to keeping server costs manageable and avoiding running out of space [[source](https://help.sonatype.com/en/staging-concepts.html)]."

      "question": "what causes Airbyte to perform a soft reset on a destination table?",
      "answer": "Airbyte performs a soft reset, also known as dropping and re-creating the final table produced by a sync, for several reasons:\n\n1. **Schema Migrations**: Many destinations lack the ability to control column order, or cannot alter one data type to another. Re-creating the table allows Airbyte to strictly control the column order and data types of each column.\n\n2. **Transactional Full Refresh**: In order to keep your final tables consistently useful, when a refresh or reset occurs, Airbyte will erase the raw tables, and then build a new temporary final table first. Airbyte attempts to do an atomic swap of old and temporary final tables, usually via a rename at the last second. Otherwise, there would be a period of time where the final table is empty, which could cause downstream issues.\n\nIn addition to these, a soft reset can also be manually triggered. For example, if you accidentally delete some records from the final table and want to repopulate them from the raw data, you can manually run a soft reset by dropping the final table entirely, unsetting the raw table's `_airbyte_loaded_at` column, and then running a sync. After the sync completes, your final table will be restored to its correct state.\n\nSources:\n- [Airbyte Documentation: Typing and Deduping](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/typing-deduping#on-final-table-re-creation)\n- [Airbyte Documentation: Manually triggering a final table re-creation](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/typing-deduping#manually-triggering-a-final-table-re-creation)"

      "answer": "There could be several reasons why you're not seeing your full balance in MetaMask. One possibility is that there is currently a cap of 64 P-Chain addresses being displayed. If this is an issue, you can get a full view of your balance by consolidating UTXOs to an address within the first 64 address limit. Any UTXOs in addresses greater than the first 64 won’t be visible in the displayed balance. You can learn more about this process [here](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/8337925-core-web-how-do-i-manually-select-utxos-to-cross-chain).\n\nIf you're trying to view your Avalanche balance, make sure you've added the Avalanche network to MetaMask. You can do this programmatically using the MetaMask Custom Networks API, as described in this [tutorial](https://docs.avax.network/build/dapp/advanced/add-avalanche-programmatically#metamask). Here's the data you'll need to add the Avalanche network:\n\n```javascript\nexport const AVALANCHE_MAINNET_PARAMS = {  \n chainId: \"0xA86A\",  \n chainName: \"Avalanche Mainnet C-Chain\",  \n nativeCurrency: {  \n name: \"Avalanche\",  \n symbol: \"AVAX\",  \n decimals: 18,  \n },  \n rpcUrls: [\"https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc\"],  \n blockExplorerUrls: [\"https://snowtrace.io/\"],  \n};  \n```\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you might want to consider using the [Core extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/core/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb) and [Core web](http://core.app/), which can fully unlock Avalanche functionality such as adding Subnets and other features."

      "answer": "The `RunnableWithMessageHistory` class in LangChain is designed to manage the chat message history for a given chain. It wraps another Runnable and manages the chat message history for it. The class is designed to append input messages and chain outputs as history, and adds the current history messages to the chain input. \n\nThe reason for appending the input message after the chain completes could be to ensure that the chain has successfully processed the input message before it is added to the history. This could be useful in scenarios where the chain might modify the input message or if there is a need to ensure that only successfully processed messages are added to the history.\n\nHowever, the exact reasoning behind this design choice is not explicitly mentioned in the provided knowledge sources.

This function will be invoked on every location change and it receives an object with properties such as `pathname`, `resource`, `action`, `autoGeneratedTitle`, and `params`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use a custom `handler` function:\n\n```jsx\nconst customTitleHandler = ({ resource, action, params }) => {  \n let title = \"Custom default\"; // Default title  \n  \n if (resource && action) {  \n title = `${resource} ${action} ${params.id}`;  \n }  \n  \n return title;  \n};  \n  \n// Usage  \n<DocumentTitleHandler handler={customTitleHandler} />;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `customTitleHandler` function generates a custom title based on the `resource`, `action`, and `params.id` properties. If these properties are not available, it defaults to \"Custom default\".\n\nYou can modify this function to suit your needs. For example, you can add more conditions or use different properties to generate the title.\n\nRemember to include the `DocumentTitleHandler` component inside the `Refine` component in your app.\n\n```jsx\nconst App = () => {  \n return (  \n <BrowserRouter>  \n <Refine  \n /* ... */  \n >  \n {/* ... */}  \n <DocumentTitleHandler handler={customTitleHandler} />  \n </Refine>  \n </BrowserRouter>  \n );  \n};\n```\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/routing/integrations/react-router#documenttitlehandler)."

      "answer": "Based on the code you provided, it seems you want to create a target marker that appears when the shoot button is pressed and stays visible for 3 seconds after the last time the button is pressed. \n\nTo achieve this, you can use the `SceneTree.create_timer()` function to create a timer that will run for 3 seconds. You can then use the `is_stopped()` function to check if the timer has stopped. If the timer has stopped, you can hide the target marker.\n\nHere's a modification of your code that should achieve this:\n\n```gdscript\nextends Sprite2D\n\nvar target_lifetime: SceneTreeTimer = null\n\n# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.\nfunc _ready() -> void:\n\tpass # Replace with function body.\n\n# Called every frame.

If it is, it stops the timer. Then it creates a new timer that will run for 3 seconds. If the shoot button is not pressed and the timer has stopped or doesn't exist, it hides the target marker.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the `modulate.a` property is being used to control the visibility of the target marker. If you're using a different method to show and hide the target marker, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFor more information on timers in Godot, you can refer to the [Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/06.heads_up_display.html) and [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73284528)."

You can use the search functionality to select only a subset of data to chart, by filtering by tags, properties, customer details, and the feedback creation date.\n\n3. Run any search. For example, if you type the phrase \"extend my trial\", that query should return feedback from customers who mentioned they wanted a trial extension, then your data can be broken down by any attribute assigned to it.\n\n4. Documents can be broken down by their tags, properties, source, sentiment, and customer properties. Highlights can be broken down by tags, properties, sentiment, and customer properties. People data can be broken down into segments and customer properties.\n\n5. You can build charts like feature requests by customer segment, top 10 product areas associated with the tag feature request, or the number of mentions of the phrase \"bad ux\" over time.\n\n6. If you want to exclude some of the data series in your chart, you can toggle their visibility in the data series table.\n\nOnce saved, a chart can be shared by embedding it in a story to create a richer write-up of your research findings or collect multiple charts into a dashboard and share a link with your team members.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [UserTesting Help Center](https://help.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/11880307512861-Charts-and-Dashboards#creating_charts)."

These actions are designed to maintain referential integrity in related records. \n\nIf the related record does not exist, the database will return an error message. This is because foreign key constraints enforce the existence of the related record when creating or updating a record.\n\nHowever, if the related record does exist, the update operation should proceed as expected. If the relation is optional, and the related record is not present, the update operation on the main record should still succeed, as the absence of the related record does not violate any constraints.\n\nHere is an example of how you might update a record with an optional relation in Prisma:\n\n```prisma\nmodel User {\n  id     String  @id @default(cuid())\n  email  String? @unique\n  author Author? @relation(fields: [email], references: [email])\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `User` model has an optional relation with the `Author` model.

This is displayed through a product block available on product templates and featured product sections, helping communicate stock levels effectively to potential customers. \n\nWhen creating a new product or editing a product in the Shopify admin, there is an option to Track quantity. When a product's quantity is being tracked, a product can eventually be Out of stock (OOS) so the product page should clearly communicate this information to customers. If this option is disabled, we are not tracking inventory so there's no need to display information related to pending transfers to your locations. Also, there's no need to display a message for low inventory since a low inventory threshold doesn't apply here. For all products where inventory is not tracked, you should expect to see an In stock status.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to this [source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/806016)."

      "answer": "Sure, I can guide you through the process of setting up a Camunda workflow locally on your Mac and integrating it with a Java Maven project. Here are the steps:\n\n**Setting up Camunda locally:**\n\n1. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed: Java Virtual Machine, and Elasticsearch. You can check the version details for these in the [supported environments](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/reference/supported-environments/).\n\n2. Download a compatible set of Camunda 8 components. Tasklist, Operate and Zeebe distributions are available for download on the [release page](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform/releases). Make sure to download and use compatible versions.\n\n3. Configure the web applications to use a port that is available. By default, the web applications like Operate and Tasklist listen both to port 8080.\n\n**Integrating with a Java Maven project:**\n\n1. To use the Java client library, declare the following Maven dependency in your project:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>  \n <groupId>io.camunda</groupId>  \n <artifactId>zeebe-client-java</artifactId>  \n <version>${zeebe.version}</version>  \n</dependency>  \n```\nYou can find the latest released version from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.camunda/zeebe-client-java).\n\n2. If you are facing issues while importing the maven archetypes for Camunda BPM, you can create a new maven project with all pom dependencies and follow till the deployment.\n\n3. After setting up your project, you can model, deploy, and start a process instance. The [camunda-platform-get-started GitHub repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-get-started) contains a hands-on guide for setting up a Camunda 8 project locally.\n\n4. If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, activate workspace file sync [refresh using built-in hooks or polling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4343735/avoiding-resource-is-out-of-sync-with-the-filesystem) to improve interaction of Eclipse and Camunda Modeler.\n\n5.

The [camunda-platform-get-started GitHub repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-get-started) contains a hands-on guide for setting up a Camunda 8 project locally.\n\n6. Once your project is set up, you can start your process application in production. For this, you might want to use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), or the database you already operate, and [secure your installation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/security/).\n\nPlease note that these are general steps and might need to be adjusted based on your specific project requirements."

The error you're encountering, `Leapwork.win.agent.exe internal error`, can be caused by a variety of factors. Let's try to troubleshoot this issue step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Check Leapwork and Browser Versions\n\nEnsure that all Leapwork components (Studio, Controller, and Agent) are on the same version. Also, check if the browser version you're using is compatible with the Leapwork version.\n\n## Step 2: Review Logs\n\nReview the agent logs for any specific error messages or exceptions that could provide more insight into the issue. The logs can be found in the following location: `C:\\ProgramData\\LEAPWORK\\Logs`.\n\n## Step 3: Check Backend Connections\n\nSometimes, backend connections, such as connecting with PuTTY, can take longer than the defined time, leading to intermittent issues. If you're using any backend connections, check if they are functioning as expected.\n\n## Step 4: Test with 'Start Web Browser' and 'Close Browser' Building Blocks\n\nTry adding 'Start Web Browser' and 'Close Browser' building blocks at the beginning of the flow. This can sometimes help with browser-related issues.\n\n## Step 5: Upgrade Leapwork\n\nIf you're using an older version of Leapwork, consider upgrading to the latest version. Some issues might have been fixed in newer releases.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about the problem.

Calls to `setUserData()` are rate limited. All calls will update the local copy of `userData` immediately. However, synchronization across participants is rate limited, with assurance that all participants end with the same `userData` value.\n\nYou can access `userData` on a participant via `participants()`:\n\n```javascript\nconst localUserData = daily.participants()['local'].userData;\nconst remoteUserData = daily.participants()[participantId].userData;\n```\n\nPlease note that a participant can only set their own local data. They cannot set other participants’ user data.

      "question": "How do I enable outbound calling on my account?",
      "answer": "To enable outbound calling on your account, you need to contact the Vocode team through Discord or at support@vocode.dev. Outbound calls are disabled by default, so you need to discuss enabling this feature for your account with them. \n\nIf you are on an Enterprise plan, you can use your own Twilio account and phone numbers with Vocode. Here are the steps to do that:\n\n1. Add a Twilio account connection: Vocode uses account connections to manage your account parameters and associate them with phone numbers and calls. You can add multiple account connections if you have multiple Twilio accounts you would like to integrate. You can quickly add an account connection via their API by providing your account SID and an auth token.\n\n```python\nfrom vocode.client import Vocode\n\nvocode_client.account_connections.create_account_connection(\n    request={\n        \"type\": \"account_connection_twilio\",\n        \"credentials\": {\n            \"twilio_account_sid\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID\",\n            \"twilio_auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\",\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n\n2. Link existing Twilio numbers to Vocode: Vocode now can make calls with your Twilio account, but their system needs to know which numbers to configure and use. They provide the `/v1/numbers/link` endpoint to add these numbers to their system. You simply need to provide the phone number, your account connection id, and whether or not the phone number should be outbound only.\n\n```python\nvocode_client.numbers.link_number(\n    phone_number=\"1234567890\",\n    telephony_account_connection=\"YOUR_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_ID\",\n    outbound_only=True\n)\n```\n\nYou can now use this phone number for outbound calls (and inbound if you have it configured).\n\nSources:\n- [Working with phone calls](https://docs.vocode.dev/open-source/telephony)\n- [IVR Navigation](https://docs.vocode.dev/ivr-navigation)\n- [Bring Your Own Telephony](https://docs.vocode.dev/bring-your-own-telephony)"

      "answer": "The preferred serialization type in Hazelcast is Compact Serialization. It is highly performant as it separates the schema from the data, uses less memory and bandwidth, and supports partial deserialization of fields without deserializing the whole object during queries or indexing. Compact serialization is now the recommended and de facto standard object serialization mechanism in Hazelcast [source](https://hazelcast.com/blog/the-hazelcast-platform-rocketing-to-the-next-level).\n\nHowever, Hazelcast also supports other serialization methods like `IdentifiedDataSerializable`, `Portable`, and Custom Serialization (using `StreamSerializer` and `ByteArraySerializer`). You can choose the one that best fits your needs [source](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/data-structures/creating-a-map#writing-objects-to-a-map).\n\nAs for the number of maps that Hazelcast can support, the provided knowledge sources do not provide specific information on this. However, Hazelcast is designed to handle large-scale data and should be able to support a large number of maps.

      "answer": "In LangChain, you can manipulate the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence using Maps. If you have an object and you want to convert it to a single string value for the next chain, you can use the `RunnablePassthrough` or `RunnableLambda` depending on your specific needs.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```javascript\nrunnable = (\n{&quot;context&quot;: retrievers , &quot;question&quot;: RunnablePassthrough()}\n| RunnablePassthrough.assign(\nhistory=RunnableLambda(memory.load_memory_variables) | itemgetter(&quot;history&quot;)\n)\n| prompts\n| model\n| StrOutputParser()\n)\n```\nIn this example, `RunnablePassthrough` is used to pass along the original input variables to future steps in the chain. If the original input was a string, then you likely just want to pass along the string. This can be done with `RunnablePassthrough`. If the original input was an object, then you likely want to pass along specific keys. For this, you can use an arrow function that takes the object as input and extracts the desired key.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following sources:\n- [Multiple Chains](https://js.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/multiple_chains)\n- [Passthroughs](https://js.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/multiple_chains#passthroughs)\n- [Manipulating outputs/inputs](https://js.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/map#manipulating-outputsinputs)"

      "answer": "Hmm, I don't know enough to give you a confident answer yet. The error message `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'handlers'` suggests that there might be an issue with how you're using the `@tool` decorator, but without seeing your code, it's hard to say exactly what the problem is.\n\nThe `@tool` decorator in LangChain is used to define a custom tool. It uses the function name as the tool name by default, and the function’s docstring as the tool’s description. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\n@tool  \ndef search(query: str) -> str:  \n \"\"\"Look up things online.\"\"\"  \n return \"LangChain\"  \n```\n\nYou can also customize the tool name and JSON args by passing them into the tool decorator:\n\n```python\nclass SearchInput(BaseModel):  \n query: str = Field(description=\"should be a search query\")  \n  \n@tool(\"search-tool\", args_schema=SearchInput, return_direct=True)  \ndef search(query: str) -> str:  \n \"\"\"Look up things online.\"\"\"  \n return \"LangChain\"  \n```\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I recommend checking the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools#tool-decorator) or opening an issue on the [LangChain GitHub page](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues)."

      "question": "what does enum do",
      "answer": "In Godot, an `enum` is essentially a shorthand for constants. It's useful when you want to assign consecutive integers to some constants. For example:\n\n```gdscript\nenum {TILE_BRICK, TILE_FLOOR, TILE_SPIKE, TILE_TELEPORT}\n\n# Is the same as:\nconst TILE_BRICK = 0\nconst TILE_FLOOR = 1\nconst TILE_SPIKE = 2\nconst TILE_TELEPORT = 3\n```\n\nIf you pass a name to the `enum`, it will put all the keys inside a constant [Dictionary](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary) of that name. This means all constant methods of a dictionary can also be used with a named `enum`. However, keys in a named `enum` are not registered as global constants. They should be accessed prefixed by the `enum`'s name (`Name.KEY`).\n\n```gdscript\nenum State {STATE_IDLE, STATE_JUMP = 5, STATE_SHOOT}\n\n# Is the same as:\nconst State = {STATE_IDLE = 0, STATE_JUMP = 5, STATE_SHOOT = 6}\n\nfunc _ready():\n # Access values with Name.KEY, prints '5'\n print(State.STATE_JUMP)\n # Use constant dictionary functions\n # prints '[\"STATE_IDLE\", \"STATE_JUMP\", \"STATE_SHOOT\"]'\n print(State.keys())\n```\n\nIn GDScript, `enum` values can be either integers or strings (the latter only when using the `export` keyword). Integer comparisons will happen faster than string comparisons, but if the primary purpose of using an `enum` is for printing values, then it makes sense to use them as strings.\n\nPlease note that in GDScript, a variable's type cannot be an `enum`. Instead, they are `int`. Godot won't complain if you set a value that is not from the `enum` you expect.\n\nSources:\n- [How to read the Godot API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/how_to_read_the_godot_api.html)\n- [GDScript Basics](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html)\n- [Data Preferences](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.html)\n- [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73434317)"

      "answer": "You can easily integrate Daily video calls into your Electron desktop application using the Daily Prebuilt and daily-js. Here's a basic guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Electron Framework**: Electron facilitates building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. Electron apps run on the Chromium engine and are written using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This means that developers can write applications using vanilla JavaScript or a framework of their choice.\n\n2. **The Basics of an Electron Application**: Electron utilizes a multi-process architecture. Apps built with Electron consist of a \"main\" process and one or more \"renderer\" processes.\n\n3. **The Main Process**: The main process runs in a Node.js environment. It contains the entry point of an Electron application and constructs one or more `BrowserWindow`s in which contents will be loaded. The main process does not have access to the DOM. The main process also controls the Electron application's lifecycle and grants access to several APIs to interact with the native OS.\n\n4. **The Renderer Process**: Each `BrowserWindow` has its own renderer process. Each renderer process is responsible for rendering the application, and contains access to the DOM. Communication with the Daily JavaScript API will take place in the renderer process.\n\nYou can follow the guide on [Integrating Daily Prebuilt with Electron](https://docs.daily.co/guides/frameworks/electron) for a step-by-step walkthrough of the process. \n\nPlease note that the guide will walk you through a very basic integration of Daily Prebuilt into an Electron demo application.

      "question": "How does Apache APISIX work with Keycloak?",
      "answer": "Apache APISIX integrates with Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, to implement OIDC-based authentication processes to protect your APIs and enable single sign-on (SSO). Keycloak supports single sign-on (SSO), which enables services to interface with Keycloak through protocols such as OIDC and OAuth 2.0[^1^].\n\nTo use Keycloak with APISIX, you need to create a client in Keycloak, which is an entity that requests Keycloak to authenticate a user. In this case, APISIX is equivalent to a client that is responsible for initiating authentication requests to Keycloak[^5^].\n\nOnce you have created a client in Keycloak, you can use the `openid-connect` plugin in APISIX to interface with Keycloak[^3^]. This plugin offers two scenarios: Authentication between Services and Authentication between Browser and Identity Providers[^6^].\n\nFor Authentication between Services, you need to set `bearer_only` to `true` and configure the `introspection_endpoint` or `public_key` attribute. In this scenario, APISIX will reject requests without a token or invalid token in the request header[^6^].\n\nFor Authentication between Browser and Identity Providers, you need to set `bearer_only` to `false`. After successful authentication, this plugin can obtain and manage the token in the cookie, and subsequent requests will use the token[^6^].\n\nHere is a sample configuration to interface with the Keycloak service[^3^]:\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes -H \"X-Api-Key: your-API-key\" -XPOST -d '\n{\n \"uri\":\"/*\",\n \"plugins\":{\n \"openid-connect\":{\n \"client_id\":\"apisix\", // Generated when keycloak creates a client\n \"client_secret\":\"d5c42c50-3e71-4bbe-aa9e-31083ab29da4\",\n \"discovery\":\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/apisix_test_realm/.well-known/openid-configuration\", // keycloak OpenID Endpoint\n \"scope\":\"openid profile\",\n \"bearer_only\":false,\n \"realm\":\"apisix_test_realm\",\n \"introspection_endpoint_auth_method\":\"client_secret_post\",\n \"redirect_uri\":\"http://127.0.0.1:9080/\"\n }\n },\n \"upstream\":{\n ...\n }\n}'\n```\n\nYou can also use the `authz-keycloak` plugin in APISIX to integrate with Keycloak[^2^]. This plugin needs the `client_id` attribute for identification and to specify the context in which to evaluate permissions when interacting with Keycloak[^7^].\n\n[^1^]: [Set Up SSO with Keycloak](https://docs.api7.ai/apisix/how-to-guide/authentication/set-up-sso-with-keycloak)\n[^2^]: [authz-keycloak](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/authz-keycloak)\n[^3^]: [Interface with External Authentication Services](https://api7.ai/blog/api-gateway-authentication#interface-with-external-authentication-services)\n[^5^]: [Create a Client](https://docs.api7.ai/apisix/how-to-guide/authentication/set-up-sso-with-keycloak#create-a-client)\n[^6^]: [openid-connect](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/openid-connect)\n[^7^]: [Client ID and secret](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/authz-keycloak)"

      "question": "how does amplitude track anonymous users?",
      "answer": "Amplitude tracks anonymous users primarily through the use of device IDs. This is one of the three different methods that Amplitude uses to identify users, the other two being Amplitude ID and user IDs. The device ID comes directly from the users' devices. For web-based applications, Amplitude sets the device ID to a randomly-generated Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) by default, which persists unless a user clears their browser cookies and/or is browsing in private mode[^1^].\n\nAmplitude also supports cross-domain tracking for anonymous users. This involves passing the device ID between different domains. For example, if a user starts on one site and then navigates to another, the device ID generated from the first site is passed as a parameter to the second site. The second site then needs to initialize the SDK with the device ID[^2^][^3^][^4^][^5^].\n\nHere's an example of how this can be done:\n\n1. From the first site, grab the device ID. For example, in JavaScript, you can use `amplitude.getInstance().options.deviceId`[^6^].\n2. Pass the device ID to the second site via a URL parameter when the user navigates. For example: `www.example.com?amp_device_id=device_id_from_site_1`[^6^].\n3. Initialize the Amplitude SDK on the second site with the device ID. For example, in JavaScript, you can use `amplitude.init(AMPLITUDE_API_KEY, null, {deviceIdFromUrlParam: true})`[^6^].\n\nPlease note that anonymous users should not be assigned a user ID[^1^]. Also, the sampling of events is based on the Amplitude ID at the time the event was ingested, so analyses that rely on user behavior on new devices may be inaccurate or skewed[^7^].\n\n[^1^]: [Track unique users - How Amplitude identifies unique users Part 1](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003135607-Track-unique-users#h_7cf7c47f-ec71-4e15-8c47-a2bda5d84186)\n[^2^]: [Cross-domain tracking - Browser SDK](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-browser/?hopt+out=#cross-domain-tracking)\n[^3^]: [Cross-domain tracking - Browser SDK](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-browser#cross-domain-tracking)\n[^4^]: [Cross-domain tracking (JavaScript) - JavaScript SDK (Maintenance)](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/javascript#cross-domain-tracking-javascript)\n[^5^]: [Cross-domain tracking - Browser SDK 2.0](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/browser-2#cross-domain-tracking)\n[^6^]: [Set up cross domain tracking - Track unique users](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003135607-Track-unique-users#h_f717e48c-460c-4a17-abd7-102327673798)\n[^7^]: [Anonymous users - Scale: Manage your event volume with dynamic behavioral sampling](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001476972-Scale-Manage-your-event-volume-with-dynamic-behavioral-sampling#h_01HAWHRRF4BT2MXAVJHS76HJF1)"

      "answer": "To partition a document using Unstructured, you can use the `partition` function. This function reads in a source document, splits the document into sections, categorizes those sections, and extracts the text associated with those sections. Depending on the document type, Unstructured uses different methods for partitioning a document.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `partition` function:\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\n\nelements = partition(filename=\"example-10k.html\")\n```\n\nYou can also pass in a file as a file-like object using the following workflow:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"example-10k.html\", \"rb\") as f:\n    elements = partition(file=f)\n```\n\nThe `partition` function uses [libmagic](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libmagic) for filetype detection. If `libmagic` is not present and the user passes a filename, `partition` falls back to detecting the filetype using the file extension. `libmagic` is required if you’d like to pass a file-like object to `partition`.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Unstructured documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/introduction/getting_started.html)."

Virtual environments are recommended. You can install it using pip:\n```python\npip install --upgrade nomic  \n```\n2. Import the `nomic` library in your Python script:\n```python\nimport nomic  \nfrom nomic import atlas  \n```\n3. Load your text file into a pandas DataFrame. For example, if your text file is a CSV, you can use `pandas.read_csv('file_path')` to load it.\n\n4. Create an Atlas Dataset using the `atlas.map_data` function. You need to specify the data and the field you want to index. For example, if your DataFrame is named `df` and you want to index the 'text' field, you can do:\n```python\ndataset = atlas.map_data(data=df, indexed_field='text')  \n```\n5.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Update Everything**: Ensure that your Foundry system and all modules are updated to the latest stable version. This can be done via the Foundry VTT Setup or The Bazaar on The Forge.\n\n2. **Disable All Modules and Try Again**: Sometimes, conflicts between modules can cause issues. Disable all your modules and try installing the module again. Don't worry, all your settings for those modules will be safe, and you can re-enable them later.\n\n3. **Check for Module Conflicts**: If the issue persists, it might be due to a conflict with another module. You can perform a module audit to identify any potential conflicts. This involves enabling safe configuration for the world, installing and using the Quick Module Enable module, and checking for any major or minor mismatches.\n\n4. **Check for Foundry Version Incompatibility**: If the module is incompatible with your installed version of Foundry VTT, you might face issues. Visit The Bazaar and update the system if an update is available.\n\n5. **Check for Premium Content Installation Issues**: If you're trying to install premium content, there might be specific issues related to that. Premium content is managed by Foundry VTT, not The Forge, and cannot be installed while a world is launched, or is on the setup menu without its admin key enabled. You can fix this by entering your admin access key in the Foundry VTT setup menu and installing the premium content directly, or by stopping all instances of Foundry VTT and trying to install the premium module again.\n\nIf you're still facing issues, consider reaching out for help in the #forge-support channel on The Forge Discord.\n\nSources:\n- [Troubleshooting in Forge/Foundry](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/troubleshooting-in-forge-foundry/11293)\n- [Performing a Module Audit](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/trouble-with-modules/12107)\n- [Foundry Version Incompatibility](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/troubleshooting-the-cannot-access-setup-page-error/15617#toc-h1-foundry-version-incompatibility)\n- [Installation Error for Premium Content](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/installing-updating-licensed-premium-modules/11537#toc-h1-installation-error)"

      "answer": "The `await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 0)` is a feature of Temporal's Python SDK that allows you to pause the execution of a workflow until a certain condition is met. \n\nIn this specific case, the workflow will pause and wait until `self.stage` is greater than 0. The `wait_condition` function takes a callback function as an argument, which is invoked on each iteration of the event loop. The workflow will continue its execution once the callback function returns `True`.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful in Temporal workflows because it allows you to handle asynchronous events in a more controlled manner. For example, you can use `wait_condition` to pause a workflow until a signal is received or a certain condition in your application state is met.\n\nHere is an example of how it can be used in a Temporal workflow:\n\n```python\n@workflow.defn\nclass MyWorkflow:\n def __init__(self):\n self.stage = 0\n\n @workflow.run\n async def run(self) -> None:\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 1\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_1, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=45))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 1\")\n await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 0)\n\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 2\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_2, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 2\")\n await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 1)\n\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 3\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_3, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=15))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 3\")\n await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.stage > 2)\n\n workflow.logger.info(\"Executing activity 4\")\n await workflow.execute_activity(my_activity_4, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=2))\n workflow.logger.info(\"Finished activity 4\")\n```\nIn this example, the workflow waits after each activity until the `stage` variable is incremented, effectively creating a sequence of activities that are executed one after the other.\n\nSources:\n- [Temporal Workflows are Asyncio Event Loops](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop)\n- [Is it possible to create an event-based workflow?](https://temporal.io/blog/community-threads-is-it-possible-to-create-an-event-based-workflow)\n- [Python SDK Documentation](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker._workflow_instance._WorkflowInstanceImpl.html)"

Here are a few things you could try:\n\n1. **Ensure you're using the correct method to access headers**: According to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers#api-reference), you can use the `get()` method on the `Headers` object to retrieve the value of a specific header. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers);\nconst host = requestHeaders.get('host');\n```\n\n2. **Check if headers are being overridden**: Next.js allows headers to be overridden if two headers match the same path and set the same header key. The last header key will override the first. You can check your `next.config.js` file to see if this is happening. More details can be found in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#header-overriding-behavior).\n\n3. **Check your deployment environment**: There have been [issues reported](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/40275) where headers are not accessible on API routes when deployed to Vercel. If you're deploying your application to Vercel, this could be the cause of your issue.\n\nIf none of these suggestions work, it would be helpful to have more information about your specific situation, such as the code you're using to access the headers and the environment in which your application is running."

This is achieved through the use of strict state access lists in the form of a UTXO model. \n\nAccess lists are used to validate transactions. They assume sequential transaction validation for side effects (i.e., state changes).

Transactions with overlapping write access lists must be validated and placed in blocks in topological order.\n\nThe read-only access list and write-destroy access list must contain UTXOs and contracts that exist (i.e., have been created previously) for a transaction to be valid. For a unique state element ID, the write-create must precede the write-destroy.\n\nThe write-create access list is used for each output, including the created UTXO ID and the contract ID for outputs of type `OutputType.ContractCreated`.\n\nThis system allows Fuel to use more threads and cores of your CPU that are typically idle in single-threaded blockchains, delivering far more compute, state accesses, and transactional throughput than its single-threaded counterparts.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Fuel documentation](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/specs/protocol/tx-validity#access-lists)."

You will need your R2 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. If you don't have these, you can follow the instructions to generate R2 credentials [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-access/s3-api/tokens/).\n```bash\nAWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=~/.cloudflare/r2.credentials aws configure --profile r2\n```\nWhen prompted, enter your R2 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

      "answer": "The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `retriever` object you're passing to `RetrieverEvaluator.from_metric_names` is not an instance of `BaseRetriever` or one of its subclasses. \n\nIn LlamaIndex, a retriever is a specific type of object that is used to retrieve information from the index. The `BaseRetriever` is the base class for all retrievers, and specific types of retrievers are subclasses of this base class. For example, in the [Custom Cohere Reranker example](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/finetuning/rerankers/cohere_custom_reranker.html), a `CustomRetriever` class is defined that inherits from `BaseRetriever`.\n\nIn your code, `index.as_retriever()` is expected to return an instance of `BaseRetriever` or one of its subclasses. If it's not, you'll get the `ValidationError` you're seeing. \n\nYou should check the type of the object returned by `index.as_retriever()` to make sure it's a `BaseRetriever` or a subclass. If it's not, you'll need to figure out why and fix it. This could be because `index` is not the type of object you think it is, or because `as_retriever()` is not implemented correctly. \n\nIf you're still having trouble, you might find it helpful to look at some of the examples in the LlamaIndex documentation, such as the [Custom Cohere Reranker example](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/finetuning/rerankers/cohere_custom_reranker.html) or the [Recursive Retriever + Node References example](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes.html).

Here are a few possibilities based on the knowledge sources provided:\n\n1. **Migration has already been applied**: If a migration has already been applied successfully, running the same migration again will not show any output. Prisma keeps track of applied migrations in the `_prisma_migrations` table in your database.\n\n2. **No changes in the schema**: If there are no changes in your Prisma schema file since the last migration, running `prisma migrate dev` will not create a new migration, hence no output.\n\n3. **Errors in the migration process**: If there are errors during the migration process, Prisma will throw an error message. However, in some cases, the error message might not be descriptive enough, making it seem like there's no output. For example, in [this issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/12856), a migration failed but the logs did not indicate what exactly failed.\n\n4. **Empty migration**: If you run `prisma migrate dev --create-only` and your current Prisma schema is already in sync with your database schema, Prisma will create an empty migration and the output will be `-- This is an empty migration.` as seen in [this issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7332).\n\nIf you're still having issues, it would be helpful to check the version of Prisma you're using and ensure it's up to date.

      "answer": "Yes, allocating 64GB of heap memory for a Hazelcast node is not recommended. To avoid long garbage collection (GC) pauses and latencies from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Hazelcast recommends 16GB or less of maximum JVM heap. If High-Density Memory is enabled, no more than 8GB of maximum JVM heap is recommended. Horizontal scaling of JVM memory is recommended over vertical scaling if you wish to exceed these numbers. \n\nIt's also important to note that it's not practical to run JVMs with greater than a 16 GB heap. For instance, to store 150 GB of active and backup data, you would need a minimum of 11 JVMs, each with a 16 GB heap. This is because a 16 GB JVM would give approximately 14 GB of storage space.\n\nIf your application uses very large amounts of data, you can still keep your heap small by using Hazelcast’s High-Density Memory Store. This feature allows you to efficiently store more data in your computer’s memory, up to 200 GB per Hazelcast node, while eliminating the many garbage collection pauses you would otherwise face when allocating large blocks of memory from the Java garbage collector.\n\nSources:\n- [JVM Recommendations](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/production-checklist#jvm-recommendations)\n- [Cluster Size Using Only Heap Memory](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/capacity-planning#cluster-size-using-only-heap-memory)\n- [Minimize Heap Usage](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/cluster-performance/performance-tuning#minimize-heap-usage)\n- [High-Density Memory Capabilities](https://hazelcast.com/blog/five-reasons-to-upgrade-to-hazelcast-enterprise)"

      "answer": "In Temporal, you can set the retry count by specifying the `maximum_attempts` attribute in the Retry Policy. This attribute specifies the maximum number of execution attempts that can be made in the presence of failures. \n\nHere is an example of how to set the retry count in Python:\n\n```python\nretry_policy = RetryPolicy(  \n maximum_attempts=3,  \n maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2),  \n non_retryable_error_types=[\"InvalidAccountError\", \"InsufficientFundsError\"],  \n)\n```\nIn this example, `maximum_attempts=3` sets the retry count to 3.\n\nIn TypeScript, you can set the retry count in the `retry` attribute of the ActivityOptions:\n\n```typescript\nconst options: ActivityOptions = {\n  retry: {\n    maximumAttempts: 3,\n    // other retry policy settings...\n  },\n  // other activity options...\n};\n```\nIn this example, `maximumAttempts: 3` sets the retry count to 3.\n\nPlease note that the default value for `maximum_attempts` is unlimited. If this limit is exceeded, the execution fails without retrying again. When this happens an error is returned. Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries. Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Temporal documentation on Retry Policies](https://docs.temporal.io/retry-policies#maximum-attempts)."

      "answer": "Yes, Leapwork does support test data management and allows you to manage all your test data centrally for all automation flows. Here are some best practices and features that Leapwork provides for test data management:\n\n## Test Data Management Best Practices\n\nWhen it comes to automation, valid test data is essential. While working with test data in Leapwork, you should ensure the following:\n\n- Test data should be part of the main test flow only. Sub-flows should not have test data.\n- Data to sub-flows should be passed as parameters, this helps to increase sub-flow re-usability.\n- Ideally, you should create test data first then execute the test. At the end of the test, delete the generated test data.\n\nThe quality, consistency, and availability of test data are also crucial. Therefore, always ensure data is ready before you commence test automation. [^1^]\n\n## Automated Test Data Generation\n\nLeapwork provides an out-of-the-box automated way to generate dynamic data using its generator blocks. These blocks can be used to generate dynamic data such as random or sequenced numbers, text, e-mail addresses, dates, time, and more. This approach allows you to create unique data every time a test flow runs without worrying about having to hard code unique data. [^2^]\n\n## Non-UI Test Data Generation\n\nLeapwork offers the capability to interact with applications without using the user interface. This enables you to generate test data through non-UI protocols such as REST API, SOAP API, and command-line interfaces like Powershell and Command Prompts. [^3^]\n\n## Using External Test Data Sources\n\nTesting with a large set of data requires data to be organized through external data sources such as Excel, CSV, text files, and databases. Leapwork enables you to interact with these external data types through its out-of-the-box integration with these tools. [^4^]\n\n## Workflow Management\n\nLeapwork's Workflow Management feature brings additional capabilities that make it easier to govern and collaborate across larger teams and multiple automation projects. It provides improved version transparency, contributor tracking, approvals, and handover. This feature allows you to track what work is in progress, what needs to be reviewed, and what has been approved by whom, making it easier to manage hundreds or thousands of flows throughout their entire lifecycle. [^5^]\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nKnowledge sources used:\n[^1^]: [Best Practices - Test Automation with Leapwork > Test Data](https://support.leapwork.com/s/article/BestPracticesTestAutomationwithLeapwork6330784726089)\n[^2^]: [Best Practices - Test Data Management & Planning > Automated test data generation in Leapwork](https://support.leapwork.com/s/article/BestPracticesTestDataManagementPlanning6330785336e5a#h_01EDEK9JCENY7JFM963R7E3AAN)\n[^3^]: [Best Practices - Test Data Management & Planning > Non UI test data generation](https://support.leapwork.com/s/article/BestPracticesTestDataManagementPlanning6330785336e5a)\n[^4^]: [Best Practices - Test Data Management & Planning > Using external test data sources with Leapwork Part 1](https://support.leapwork.com/s/article/BestPracticesTestDataManagementPlanning6330785336e5a#h_01G2S1PXXRSR8E03RA3A9AR2EW)\n[^5^]: [Product > Documentation > 11.

      "answer": "In Refine, you can use the `useNavigation` hook to navigate to different pages. This hook provides methods like `show()`, `edit()`, and `create()` which can be used inside buttons to navigate to their respective routes. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useNavigation } from \"@refinedev/core\";\n\nconst { edit, show, create } = useNavigation();\n\n// Inside your component\n<Button onClick={() => edit(\"resourceName\", \"itemId\")}>Edit Item</Button>\n```\n\nIn the example above, clicking the button will navigate to the edit page of the specified resource item.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/navigation/useNavigation/).\n\nPlease note that the actual button component you use may vary based on your UI library. The example above assumes you have a `Button` component that accepts an `onClick` prop.\n\nAlso, replace `\"resourceName\"` and `\"itemId\"` with the actual resource name and item ID you want to navigate to.\n\nSources:\n- [Building a React Admin Panel with Refine and daisyUI](https://refine.dev/blog/daisy-ui-react-admin-panel#productlist--page)\n- [Refine Documentation - useNavigation](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/navigation/useNavigation/)"

      "question": "hi i have 500 records on board how can i get it all ?",
      "answer": "To retrieve all 500 items from your board, you can use the monday.com API which uses cursor-based pagination. Here are the steps you need to follow:\n\n1. Start by running a GraphQL `items_page` query to retrieve the first 500 items from the board. Don't forget to include your board ID as an argument. Here is a sample query:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  boards (ids: 1234567890){\n    items_page {\n      cursor\n      items {\n        id \n        name \n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. This query returns a cursor value and the first 500 items on your board. Using that cursor value as an argument, run a `next_items_page` query to fetch the next relevant set of items. Please keep in mind that each cursor is valid for 60 minutes after the initial request. Here is a sample query:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  next_items_page (cursor: \"MSw5NzI4MDA5MDAsaV9YcmxJb0p1VEdYc1VWeGlxeF9kLDg4MiwzNXw0MTQ1NzU1MTE5\") {\n    cursor\n    items {\n      id\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. This query returns another cursor value and the following 500 items on the board. Repeat the same query using the consecutive cursor values until you have paginated through the entire data set.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Querying board items](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/querying-board-items) guide in the monday.com API documentation."

      "question": "can I deploy any website from here",
      "answer": "Yes, you can deploy a website on Netlify. There are several ways to do this:\n\n1. **Drag and Drop**: This is the simplest and quickest deployment method. You can drop a folder or zip file in the specified box at the bottom of the page at [Netlify's drop zone](https://app.netlify.com/account/sites/) (once you have logged in). To update your site, just go to your Deploys page for that site and drag and drop right there. [Source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/146)\n\n2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: This is often the easiest way to integrate with 3rd-party Continuous Integration tools, and it doesn’t even require using the Netlify User Interface. Everything is done from your terminal’s command line. All you need is the directory with your files on your machine. To set up the CLI follow these [brief instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/). [Source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/146)\n\n3. **Git-backed continuous deployment**: This is the best workflow for people using git-backed repositories. If you already have your site in a repo you can deploy immediately upon commit, automatically! [Source](https://answers.netlify.com/t/146)\n\n4. **Netlify UI**: You can deploy your site by clicking ‘Add new site’ on your ‘Team Overview’ or ‘Sites’ page. You can choose from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, then choose the project you’d like to create a site from. [Source](https://www.netlify.com/blog/deploy-your-angular-v17-apps-to-netlify)\n\n5. **Deploy to Netlify button**: For some projects, a \"Deploy to Netlify\" button is created. Clicking on this button deploys a copy of the final version of the project on your Netlify account. [Source](https://www.netlify.com/blog/website-personalization-with-storyblok-and-nextjs)\n\n6. **Import from an existing repository**: You can import an existing project from a Git repository and deploy it on Netlify. When you import your existing project repository to Netlify, their continuous deployment will automatically update your site each time you push changes. [Source](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site)\n\n7. **Use Netlify Templates**: With Netlify Templates, you can choose from a number of prebuilt starter projects that use popular libraries and tools from the Jamstack ecosystem. Once your site is deployed, it will be automatically updated with each commit through Netlify’s continuous deployment. [Source](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site#use-netlify-templates)\n\nPlease note that Netlify is designed for a specific type of website: Jamstack sites. If your site requires a server-based dynamic site like Internet Information Server (IIS) and the .NET framework, you would have to use a different service.

      "answer": "Gecko OS is an IoT operating system developed by Silicon Labs. It runs on Silicon Labs wireless and wired IoT connectivity modules. The OS is designed to help developers build wireless IoT applications by simplifying the complexity of hardware, protocols, and standards. All Wireless Xpress products from Silicon Labs are powered by Gecko OS, making use of the Gecko OS Command API [[source](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/2/amw007-w00001/latest#index#general-overview)].\n\nThe Gecko OS 2 Command API is available for applications connecting with a wired serial interface, or a wireless interface using HTTP REST or Remote Terminal. The API provides direct access to peripherals connected to Gecko OS hardware via GPIO [[source](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/2/amw007-w00001/latest#index#general-overview)].\n\nTo start using your Gecko OS hardware, you can refer to the [Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/2/amw007-w00001/latest/getting-started) guide. This guide will help you establish control over your Gecko OS device and experiment with the rich set of Gecko OS features using the Gecko OS Command API [[source](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/2/amw007-w00001/latest/getting-started#gecko-os-applications)].\n\nFor additional help, Gecko OS provides interactive command line help. You can issue the `help` command at the Gecko OS terminal prompt to get help options for the Gecko OS Command API [[source](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/2/amw007-w00001/latest/getting-started#getting-help)].\n\nSilicon Labs also provides platforms that run Gecko OS.

      "answer": "`ScanAllByLabel` is an operator in Memgraph that produces nodes with a certain label. It is part of the query plan when running a query on your data. If there is no index on the data, you will see `ScanAllByLabel` operations in your query plan. For example:\n\n```\nmemgraph> EXPLAIN MATCH (n:Person {prop: 1}) RETURN n;\n+-----------------------------------+\n| QUERY PLAN |\n+-----------------------------------+\n| \" * Produce {n}\" |\n| \" * Filter (n :Person), {n.prop}\" |\n| \" * ScanAllByLabel (n :Person)\" |\n| \" * Once\" |\n+-----------------------------------+\n```\n\nHowever, if an index is being used, the `ScanAllByLabel` operation will be replaced by a more efficient operation such as `ScanAllByLabelPropertyValue`. This operation produces nodes with a certain label and property value. Here's an example:\n\n```\nmemgraph> EXPLAIN MATCH (n:Person {prop: 1}) RETURN n;\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n| QUERY PLAN |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n| \" * Produce {n}\" |\n| \" * ScanAllByLabelPropertyValue (n :Person {prop})\" |\n| \" * Once\" |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\nYou can create an index on a property of a certain label using the `CREATE INDEX ON` syntax. For example, to create an index on the `prop` property of the `Person` label, you would use:\n\n```\nCREATE INDEX ON :Person(prop);\n```\n\nTo check all the labels and label-property pairs that Memgraph currently indexes, you can use the `SHOW INDEX INFO;` query.\n\nSources:\n- [Memgraph Docs: Fundamentals > Indexes](https://memgraph.com/docs/fundamentals/indexes)\n- [Memgraph Docs: Querying > Performance optimization](https://memgraph.com/docs/querying/performance-optimization)"

      "question": "relationship between replication lag and wal retention",
      "answer": "Replication lag and WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) retention are two important concepts in distributed databases like YugabyteDB.\n\n**Replication Lag**\nReplication lag measures how far behind in time a replica lags the primary. In a failover scenario, the longer the lag, the more data is at risk of being lost. YugabyteDB allows you to set up alerts for replication lag, so you can take remedial measures if the lag exceeds a specific threshold [[source](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/disaster-recovery/disaster-recovery-setup#set-up-replication-lag-alerts)].\n\n**WAL Retention**\nWAL retention refers to how long the database retains the Write-Ahead Logs. These logs are used to protect data written to memory. In YugabyteDB, each shard has its own WAL stream. The retention of these logs can be increased for Change Data Capture (CDC) by changing the `cdc_intent_retention_ms` and `cdc_wal_retention_time_secs` flags. However, longer values can result in an increased memory footprint in the YB-TServer and affect read performance [[source](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/change-data-capture/cdc-get-started#retaining-data-for-longer-durations)].\n\n**Relationship**\nThe relationship between replication lag and WAL retention can be seen in the context of data recovery and consistency. If a replica lags too far behind the primary, it may need older WAL records to catch up. If these records have been discarded due to the WAL retention policy, the replica may not be able to achieve consistency with the primary, leading to potential data loss. Therefore, a balance needs to be struck between minimizing replication lag and managing WAL retention effectively."

      "answer": "CockroachDB recommends using the managed load balancing services provided by the cloud platform where your database is deployed. Here are some specific recommendations:\n\n- For [On-Premises](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/deploy-cockroachdb-on-premises#step-6-set-up-load-balancing) deployments, use HAProxy.\n- For [AWS](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/deploy-cockroachdb-on-aws#step-4-set-up-load-balancing) deployments, use Amazon's managed load balancing service.\n- For [Azure](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/deploy-cockroachdb-on-microsoft-azure#step-4-set-up-load-balancing) deployments, use Azure's managed load balancing service.\n- For [Digital Ocean](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/deploy-cockroachdb-on-digital-ocean#step-3-set-up-load-balancing) deployments, use Digital Ocean's managed load balancing service.\n- For [GCP](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/deploy-cockroachdb-on-google-cloud-platform#step-4-set-up-load-balancing) deployments, use GCP's managed TCP proxy load balancing service.\n\nRemember, the purpose of using a load balancer is to spread client traffic across nodes, preventing any one node from being overwhelmed by requests and improving overall cluster performance. It also decouples client health from the health of a single CockroachDB node, redirecting client traffic to available nodes in case a node fails."

Here's what I've done so far:\n\nCreated a simple layout component:\n\n```\n---\nimport { ViewTransitions } from \"astro:transitions\";\n---\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<ViewTransitions />\n</head>\n<body>\n<slot />\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAdded the layout property to MDX files in the docs directory:\n\n```\n---\nlayout: ../../../../layouts/StarlightLayout.astro\n---\n```\n\nThe issue I'm encountering is that when I click on any sidebar links, the page flashes and momentarily resets the styles. Other languages without custom layouts work fine, with a standard page reload (although I'm not entirely sure anymore if this is normal)\n\nTo troubleshoot, I tried the following:\n\n- Removed `customCss: [\"./src/styles/starlight.css\"]` from the astro.configo and imported the CSS directly into the layout. However, the issue persisted.\n-  Checked the console and noticed some CSP errors from Vercel. Adjusted the configuration to eliminate the errors, issue persisted.\n- Reverted all changes, including removing the CSS import and restoring the default Starlight theme, issue persisted\n- Removed custom Tailwind plugins, issue persisted.\n\nInterestingly, everything works smoothly in local development mode without any flashes or style resets.\n\nAdditionally, I'm encountering a \"Failed to load resource\" error for TableOfContents.astro, although the TOC is displaying fine on the page.",
      "answer": "Based on the information provided in the knowledge sources, it seems like you're encountering some common issues with Astro's ViewTransitions. Here are some potential solutions and explanations:\n\n1. **Flashing and Style Resets**: This could be due to the way ViewTransitions works. When you navigate to a new page, Astro creates default page animations based on the similarities between the old and new page. This might cause a brief \"flash\" as the old page content fades out and the new page content fades in ([source](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-view-transitions#add-the-viewtransitions--router)).\n\n2. **Issues with Sidebar Links**: If you're using a smaller screen size and trying to use a hamburger menu to navigate between pages, you might notice that your menu will no longer work after the first page load ([source](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-view-transitions#add-the-viewtransitions--router)).\n\n3. **Issues with Scripts**: If you're using scripts in your layout, you might encounter issues with them not working as expected when using ViewTransitions. There are some workarounds suggested in the Discord support thread, such as wrapping your script in an init function ([source](https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/1193760306690793552)).\n\n4. **\"Failed to load resource\" Error**: This could be due to a variety of reasons, and without more specific information, it's hard to provide a definitive solution. However, it's worth noting that some users have reported similar issues on GitHub and Discord, and it might be worth checking out those threads for potential solutions ([source](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/8341), [source](https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/1210302661946253342)).\n\nRemember, these are just potential solutions based on the information provided in the knowledge sources.

      "question": "What is the difference between stream position and commit position?",
      "answer": "In EventStoreDB, the terms \"stream position\" and \"commit position\" refer to different aspects of event location within the database.\n\n**Stream Position**: This refers to the position of an event within an individual stream. Each event in EventStoreDB belongs to an individual stream name. When reading events, you can pick the name of the stream you want to read from and choose whether to read that stream forwards or backwards. All events have a `StreamPosition`, which is the place of the event in the stream, represented by a *big int* (unsigned 64-bit integer) [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/clients/grpc/reading-events#reading-events). \n\nIn the gRPC client, the `StreamPosition` class centralises stream position handling. It has a `Start` and an `End` constant representing the logical stream's position. However, they no longer return `long` values but a `StreamPosition` class instance. `StreamPosition` class has an overloaded operator for `ulong` value assignment [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/clients/tcp/dotnet/21.2/migration-to-grpc#read-positions).\n\n**Commit Position**: This refers to the physical event position in the global log. When reading events from EventStoreDB, you get several system metadata properties in the event structure on the client side, one of which is the commit position. Due to the fact that in the source database the global log has gaps caused by deleted or truncated streams, as well as expired events, the commit position in the target database will not be the same for all events [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/use#system-metadata).\n\nFor the `$all` stream, the checkpoint consists of two positions in the global event storage - prepare position and commit position [source](https://developers.eventstore.com/clients/tcp/dotnet/21.2/subscriptions#catch-up-subscriptions). \n\nIn summary, the stream position is specific to an individual stream and represents the location of an event within that stream. The commit position, on the other hand, is a global position that represents the location of an event within the entire event log of the database."

The Lua function you've provided seems to be correctly formatted, but the JSON that wraps it might be causing the issue.\n\nHere's a general example of how to configure the `serverless-pre-function` plugin:\n\n```json\n{\n \"uri\": \"/index.html\",\n \"plugins\": {\n \"serverless-pre-function\": {\n \"phase\": \"rewrite\",\n \"functions\" : [\"return function() ngx.log(ngx.ERR, 'serverless pre function'); end\"]\n }\n }\n}\n```\n(Source: [APISIX Serverless Plugin Documentation](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/serverless))\n\nPlease check your JSON formatting and ensure that all arrays and objects are correctly opened and closed, and that all items in arrays and objects are separated by commas. You might find it helpful to use a JSON formatter or validator to check your JSON syntax.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about what you're trying to achieve, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

      "answer": "There could be several reasons why color swatches are not showing on your products. Here are a few things you can check based on the information provided in the knowledge sources:\n\n1. **Swatch Settings**: Make sure you have enabled the color swatch settings in your theme. You can add color swatches to your product and collection pages using the settings found in Theme settings > Product Tiles. Also, you can enable color swatches for filtering on collection pages using the settings found in the Collection template > Product grid > Enable color swatches. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2765)\n\n2. **Variant Category Name**: Once you have enabled the color swatch settings, your theme will look for any variant category with the name \"Color\" or \"Colour\". If you have used a different word for your color variants, you can change it to \"Color/Colour\" in your languages area under Edit theme content > Products > General > Color swatch trigger. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2765)\n\n3. **Swatch Files**: The theme will look for either an HTML color name with the exact same name or a .png image file in Content > Files with a filename-friendly version of your variant name. For example, Green swatches would need to be named green.png (capitals become lowercase). Make sure your swatch files are named correctly and are in .png format. .jpg files will not be shown. [Source](https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2765)\n\n4. **Theme Compatibility**: If you're using any apps, make sure they are compatible with your Archetype theme. If the issue is being introduced by an app or custom code, you may need to reach out to the app developer's support team or to the developer, expert, or agency that worked on any customizations.

      "answer": "The 500 error code in Portainer usually occurs when performing actions that involve interacting with the Docker engine, such as creating or updating a container. This error can make it difficult to understand the underlying cause. \n\nTo investigate the error, you can use your web browser's developer console. Here are the steps to open the developer tools in different browsers:\n\n- **Chrome:** press **Ctrl-Shift-I** on Windows (or **Cmd-Option-I** on Mac), or click the three dot menu in the top right and go to **More tools**, then select **Developer tools**.\n- **Firefox:** press **Ctrl-Shift-I** on Windows (or **Cmd-Option-I** on Mac), or click the three line menu in the top right and go to **More tools**, then select **Web Developer Tools**.\n- **Microsoft Edge:** press **Ctrl-Shift-I** or click the three dot menu in the top right and go to **More tools**, then select **Developer tools**.\n- **Safari:** From the Safari menu, select **Preferences**, then **Advanced**. Check the **Show Develop menu in menu bar** option. You can then access the developer tools from the **Develop** menu in the menu bar.\n\nWith the tools open, select the **Network** tab, then go back to the Portainer window (keeping the developer tools open) and perform the action. Then go back to your developer tools window and find the call in the Network tab that has reported the 500 error (it should be highlighted in red). Select it, then select the **Response** tab. This should hopefully show you the error returned from the engine.\n\nThere are also reported issues on GitHub about the 500 error occurring when trying to recreate containers in Portainer Business Edition. The error seems to occur regardless of how the container was created or its network configuration. The issue is still open and under investigation by the Portainer team.\n\nSources:\n- [What does a 500 error code mean?](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-does-a-500-error-code-mean)\n- [Portainer 2.17.0 Business Edition no longer able to recreate containers - Error 500](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/8507)"

      "answer": "Calico and Istio serve different but complementary roles in a Kubernetes environment. \n\nCalico is primarily a networking and network security solution. It provides networking for workloads in high scale environments, such as VMs and containers, and is designed to be more scalable, simpler, and more flexible than traditional L2-based methods. Calico also provides a rich network security model that allows operators and developers to declare intent-based network security policy that is automatically rendered into distributed firewall rules across a cluster of containers, VMs, and/or servers [source](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/reference/faq#why-use-calico).\n\nIstio, on the other hand, is a service mesh that provides a way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio provides features like load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring.\n\nCalico can integrate with Istio to provide additional benefits. The Calico support for Istio service mesh includes pod traffic controls, support for security goals like zero trust network model, and a familiar policy language. Users do not need to learn another network policy model to adopt Istio when using Calico [source](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/network-policy/istio/app-layer-policy#benefits-of-the-istio-integration).\n\nIn summary, while Istio provides service mesh capabilities, Calico provides the underlying networking and network security. They can be used together to provide a comprehensive networking, security, and service mesh solution for Kubernetes environments."

      "answer": "The `POST /self-service/verification` endpoint in Ory behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states. If you're getting a 303 See Other redirect, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. If you're using a browser client without the HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*`, the endpoint will return a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended.\n\n2. If the form is invalid, for API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json`, the endpoint will return a HTTP 400 OK. However, if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired), it will return a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh verification flow.\n\n3. In the `passed_challenge` state, which expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query, the server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.\n\nPlease ensure that you're sending the correct parameters and headers with your request.

However, the exact performance difference between AtlasOS and the official Windows 11 can vary depending on the specific hardware and use case. One user reported a 2-3x improvement in FPS in Valorant after switching to AtlasOS from the official Windows version [source](https://forum.atlasos.net/d/64-my-personal-review-of-atlasos).\n\nAs for the comparison between AtlasOS Windows 10 and AtlasOS Windows 11, both are supported equally and can be used to install AtlasOS. The choice between Windows 10 and Windows 11 would depend on your system's compatibility and your personal preference. It's recommended to choose Windows 11 if your system meets the official requirements [source](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/installation#installing-atlasos). \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the performance can vary based on the specific version of AtlasOS.

      "answer": "The `.attach(lifecycleOwner = this)` is a method used in the Mapbox Navigation SDK to attach a `LifecycleOwner` to the `MapboxNavigationApp`. This is typically used in the context of setting up the `MapboxNavigationApp` within an Android Activity or Fragment. \n\nHere is an example of how it's used in a Fragment:\n\n```kotlin\nclass MyFragment : Fragment {  \n override fun onCreateView() {  \n if (!MapboxNavigationApp.isSetup()) {  \n MapboxNavigationApp.setup {  \n NavigationOptions.Builder(context)  \n .accessToken(\"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\")  \n .attach(lifecycleOwner = this)  \n .build()  \n }  \n }  \n }  \n}  \n```\n\nAnd here is how it's used in an Activity:\n\n```kotlin\nclass MyActivity : Activity {  \n init {  \n lifecycle.addObserver(object : DefaultLifecycleObserver {  \n override fun onResume(owner: LifecycleOwner) {  \n MapboxNavigationApp.attach(owner)  \n }  \n  \n override fun onPause(owner: LifecycleOwner) {  \n MapboxNavigationApp.detach(owner)  \n }  \n })  \n }  \n   \n override fun onCreate() {  \n if (!MapboxNavigationApp.isSetup()) {  \n MapboxNavigationApp.setup {  \n NavigationOptions.Builder(context)  \n .accessToken(\"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\")  \n .build()  \n }  \n }  \n }  \n}  \n```\n\nIn both examples, the `LifecycleOwner` (which can be an Activity, Fragment, or a custom `LifecycleOwner`) is attached to the `MapboxNavigationApp`. This allows the `MapboxNavigationApp` to create a `MapboxNavigation` instance when the `LifecycleOwner` is in the `CREATED` state.\n\nIf you're seeing an \"Unresolved reference: attach\" error, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The `MapboxNavigationApp` class is not imported in your file.\n2. The version of the Mapbox Navigation SDK you're using does not have the `attach` method. Make sure you're using a version that supports this method.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Mapbox Navigation SDK documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/v2/guides/get-started/initialization#2-attach-lifecycleowner)."

      "question": "Abstract method 'cancelFulfillment' in class 'AbstractFulfillmentService' cannot be accessed via super expression.ts(2513)\ni called super on it but it didnt work",
      "answer": "The `cancelFulfillment` method is part of the `FulfillmentService` class in Medusa. If you're extending this class and want to override the `cancelFulfillment` method, you can do so without calling `super.cancelFulfillment()`. \n\nHere's an example of how you can implement the `cancelFulfillment` method in your own class that extends `FulfillmentService`:\n\n```javascript\nclass MyFulfillmentService extends FulfillmentService {  \n // ...  \n async cancelFulfillment(  \n fulfillment: Record<string, unknown>  \n ): Promise<any> {  \n return {}  \n }  \n}  \n```\n\nIn this example, `cancelFulfillment` is an asynchronous method that takes a `fulfillment` parameter and returns a Promise. The `fulfillment` parameter is the `data` attribute of the fulfillment being canceled.\n\nPlease note that the `cancelFulfillment` method isn't expected to return any specific data. It's used when a fulfillment is cancelled by the admin, and this fulfillment can be for an order, a claim, or a swap.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/carts-and-checkout/backend/add-fulfillment-provider#cancelfulfillment)."

      "answer": "Based on the provided code and the information from the knowledge sources, it seems like you are trying to create a product with a variant in Medusa. However, there are a few things that might be causing the issue:\n\n1. The `variants` array in your code does not include all the required fields. According to the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/medusa/classes/medusa.AdminPostProductsProductVariantsReq), a variant should include a `title`, `prices`, and `options`. The `prices` field is an array that should include the `amount` and `currency_code`. The `options` field is also an array that should include `option_id` and `value`. Your current `variants` array does not include these fields.\n\n2. The `create` method you are using might not be the correct one for creating product variants. According to the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/services/classes/services.ProductVariantService#create), you should use the `createVariant` method to create a product variant.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a product variant using the `createVariant` method:\n\n```javascript\nmedusa.admin.products.createVariant(productId, {  \n title: \"Color\",  \n prices: [  \n {  \n amount: 1000,  \n currency_code: \"eur\"  \n }  \n ],  \n options: [  \n {  \n option_id,  \n value: \"S\"  \n }  \n ],  \n inventory_quantity: 100  \n})  \n.then(({ product }) => {  \n console.log(product.id);  \n})  \n```\n\nPlease ensure that you are using the correct method and providing all the required fields.

      "answer": "The error message you're seeing is a parse error, which means there's a problem with the syntax of your GraphQL mutation. In your case, the error is occurring at the `column_values` argument. \n\nIn GraphQL, when you're passing a JSON object as an argument, you need to make sure it's properly formatted as a string. This is because GraphQL expects a string for the `column_values` argument, not a JavaScript object. \n\nYou're already using `JSON.stringify()` to convert your `columnValues` object into a string, which is correct. However, the issue might be that the resulting string needs to be wrapped in quotes to be properly recognized as a string in the GraphQL mutation.\n\nHere's how you can modify your mutation:\n\n```javascript\nconst mutation = `mutation {\n  change_multiple_column_values(item_id:${payload.user.mondayId}, board_id:1399424616, column_values: \"${JSON.stringify(columnValues).replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"')}\") {\n    id\n  }\n}`;\n```\n\nIn this modified version, I've added additional quotes around `${JSON.stringify(columnValues)}` and used `.replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"')` to escape any internal quotes in your JSON string. This ensures that the entire JSON string is treated as a single string argument in the GraphQL mutation.\n\nPlease give this a try and see if it resolves your issue. If you're still having trouble, I'd recommend checking the [monday.com API documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/columns#change-multiple-column-values) for more examples and details on how to structure your mutations."

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project depends on several factors such as the range, power consumption, data rate requirements, and the specific use case of your project. Here are some guidelines based on the information provided by Silicon Labs:\n\n1. **Understand Your Requirements**: Identify the specific needs of your IoT project. This includes the range of operation, data rate requirements, power consumption limits, and the nature of the devices that will be part of the network. \n\n2. **Consider the Available Options**: Silicon Labs provides a range of wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Smart, Zigbee, and 802.15.4 mesh networking protocols. Each of these has its strengths and limitations. For instance, Wi-Fi is great for high data rates but consumes more power. Bluetooth Smart is ideal for connecting point solutions to smartphones and for bulk data transfers on battery-power devices. Zigbee and Thread are optimized for low bandwidth control and automation applications where multi-year battery life is critical.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Design Choices**: When developing a solution, you need to make several design choices. These include which Silicon Labs wireless technology to use, whether to use an SoC (system-on-chip) design or an NCP (network coprocessor) design, and if using the NCP model, how to select compatible NCP and host applications.\n\n4. **Consider Multi-Protocol Devices**: Implementing more than one protocol on a single device allows for cost savings, space savings, and energy savings. Silicon Labs provides support for multiprotocol devices and the infrastructure requirements for an effective implementation.\n\n5. **Consider the Cost**: A proprietary protocol can reduce system cost significantly by streamlining an implementation, thus minimizing the processor resources required as well as avoiding the costs associated with compliance testing and logo licensing.\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of your IoT project. Therefore, it's crucial to make an informed decision based on your specific needs.\n\nSources:\n- [Fundamentals Design Choices](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)\n- [Thread Ushering in Era of Connectivity](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Thread-Ushering-in-Era-of-Connectivity.pdf)\n- [Multiprotocol Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf)\n- [Maximize Wireless Network Range and Battery Life](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Maximize-Wireless-Network-Range-and-Battery-Life.pdf)"

These are both found in the recipe sentence that ties them together.\n\nFor example, you might want to create a new recipe that triggers when a lead is created in Salesforce, and the action could be to create an item in monday.com. Or, when a status changes to something, you might want to send an email to a user. \n\nYou can use built-in triggers and actions or create custom ones using workflow blocks. This gives you the flexibility to create any workflow you could imagine. Workflow blocks are the core components of an integration in monday.com. They allow users to encapsulate triggers and actions so they can be used in app recipes, but also, inside the custom recipe builder in the automation center.\n\nSources:\n- [Intro to integration recipes](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/quickstart-integration)\n- [What is a workflow block?](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/workflow-blocks)"

      "answer": "The Ory SDK provides a way to handle errors at different levels of the flow. These include request level errors, method level errors, and field level errors. \n\nHere is a TypeScript example using the Ory SDK:\n\n```typescript\n// call the sdk  \n// sdk...  \n.then(({data: flow}) => {  \n  // error message can also exist inside the flow data even when the request is successful.  \n  // It is usually the case when we retrieved the login flow using the flow ID and the flow was submitted previously  \n  // but still contains errors.  \n  \n  // method level error  \n  // messages is an array of error messages  \n  err.response?.data?.ui.messages.forEach((message) => {  \n    console.log(message)  \n  })  \n  \n  // field level error  \n  err.response?.data?.ui.nodes.forEach(({ messages }) => {  \n    // messages is an array of error messages  \n    messages.forEach((message) => {  \n      console.log(message)  \n    })  \n  })  \n})  \n.catch((err: AxiosError) => {  \n  // if the request failed but the response is not only an error  \n  // it will contain flow data which can be used to display error messages  \n  // this is common when submitting a form (e.g. login or registration)  \n  // and getting a response status 400 `Bad Request` back.  \n  \n  if (err.response.status === 400) {  \n    // method level error  \n    // messages is an array of error messages  \n    err.response?.data?.ui.messages.forEach((message) => {  \n      console.log(message)  \n    })  \n  \n    // field level error  \n    err.response?.data?.ui.nodes.forEach(({ messages }) => {  \n      // messages is an array of error messages  \n      messages.forEach((message) => {  \n        console.log(message)  \n      })  \n    })  \n  } else {  \n    // request level error  \n    if (err.response?.data?.error) {  \n      console.log(err.response.data.error)  \n    }  \n  }  \n})  \n```\n\nThis code handles the errors by checking the response data for error messages at different levels and logging them. \n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Ory documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/bring-your-own-ui/custom-ui-basic-integration#error-handling)."

      "answer": "The best way to compare two different datasets and take action based on shared property values is by using the Compare Datasets node in n8n. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.\n\n2. Optionally, you can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.\n\n3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:\n   - **Use Input A Version**\n   - **Use Input B Version**\n   - **Use a Mix of Versions**\n   - **Include Both Versions**\n\nThe comparison is a two-stage process:\n\n1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.\n\n2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [n8n documentation on Compare Datasets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets#compare-datasets).\n\nFor practical examples of how to use the Compare Datasets node, you can check out the [n8n's Compare Datasets integrations page](https://n8n.io/integrations/compare-datasets/) and this [step-by-step tutorial on comparing databases](https://blog.n8n.io/compare-databases#step-3-compare-sql-and-pipedrive-data)."

      "answer": "Network Volumes are a feature specific to RunPod's Secure Cloud that allows you to create a volume that multiple pods can interact with. This provides an extra amount of flexibility, especially when working with a high demand GPU pool that may not always be available. You can create a pod in a different pool while you wait for an option to free up. This can also save you time by downloading frequently used models or other large files to a volume and holding them for later use, rather than having to re-download them every time you spin up a new pod [[source](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/create-network-volumes)].\n\nNetwork volumes are also a way to share data between Workers: they are mounted to the same path on each Worker. For example, if a Worker contains a large-language model, you can use a network volume to share the model across all Workers [[source](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints#add-a-network-volume)].\n\nWhen you choose to create a Network Volume, you gain access to RunPod's robust infrastructure, which includes state-of-the-art storage servers located in the same datacenters where you rent GPU servers. These servers are connected via a high-speed 25Gbps local network, up to 200Gbps in some locations, guaranteeing efficient data transfer and minimal latency. Everything is stored on high-speed NVME SSDs to ensure the best performance [[source](https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#how-does-network-volume-billing-work)].\n\nNetwork volumes allow you to share data between Pods and generally be more mobile with your important data. This feature is only available in specific secure cloud data centers, but RunPod is actively rolling it out to more and more of its secure cloud footprint. If you use network volumes, you should rarely run into situations where you cannot use your data with a GPU without a file transfer [[source](https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#why-do-i-have-zero-gpus-assigned-to-my-pod)]."

This operation can be used in a nested manner within an `update()` operation.\n\nHere's an example of a nested `upsert` within an `update` operation:\n\n```ts\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n  data: {\n    profile: {\n      upsert: {\n        create: { bio: 'Hello World' },\n        update: { bio: 'Hello World' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `upsert` operation is used to either update the `profile` of a `user` with the email 'alice@prisma.io' if it exists, or create a new `profile` if it does not exist.\n\nYou can also use the `upsert` operation to update or create multiple related records. Here's an example:\n\n```ts\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n  data: {\n    posts: {\n      upsert: [\n        {\n          create: { title: 'This is my first post' },\n          update: { title: 'This is my first post' },\n          where: { id: 32 },\n        },\n        {\n          create: { title: 'This is my second post' },\n          update: { title: 'This is my second post' },\n          where: { id: 23 },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `upsert` operation is used to either update two `post` records related to a `user` with the email 'alice@prisma.io' if they exist, or create new `post` records if they do not exist.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Prisma documentation on [upsert](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#upsert) and [nested upsert within update](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#upsert-1).\n\nPlease note that there are some open issues on GitHub related to nested `upsert` operations in Prisma, such as [Nested `upsert` failing due to table in `where` clause](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23445) and [Nested upsert triggers with undefined id triggers `The table `(not available)` does not exist in the current database.`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22621).

Here are the steps to clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git\ncd airbyte\n```\n\nAfter running these commands, you should be in the root directory of the Airbyte project where the `.env` file is located.\n\nPlease note that the `.env` file is used to set environment variables for configuring Airbyte. If you're running Airbyte using Docker, the `docker-compose.yaml` file will inject these variables into the containers. If you're running Airbyte on Kubernetes, you'll need to modify the `values.yaml` file instead.\n\nSources:\n- [Building an E-commerce Data Pipeline: A Hands-On Guide to Using Airbyte, dbt, Dagster, and BigQuery](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/building-an-e-commerce-data-pipeline-a-hands-on-guide-to-using-airbyte-dbt-dagster-and-bigquery)\n- [Configuring Airbyte](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/configuring-airbyte)"

      "question": "what is a custom emails directory? is it the file that i wrote my email function in?",
      "answer": "A custom emails directory in Netlify is a specific location in your project where you store your email templates. It's not the file where you write your email function, but rather the place where you keep the HTML templates for the emails you want to send.\n\nBy default, the emails directory is located in your base directory and is named `emails`. The structure would look something like this:\n\n```\nrepository-root or base directory/\n├─ emails/\n│  └─ subscribed/\n│   └─ index.html\n└─\n```\n\nIn this example, `subscribed` is a subdirectory representing the expected route of your template, and `index.html` is the actual email template file.\n\nIf you want to use a different location for your emails directory, you can configure a custom emails directory. You can do this by setting the `NETLIFY_EMAILS_DIRECTORY` environment variable or updating the directory value in the Netlify UI. To do this in the Netlify UI, you would visit **Integrations > Emails > Email Integration configuration**, select **Configure**, and enter a custom **Emails directory**.\n\nRemember, the email templates you create in this directory should include HTML and must include `<html>` and `<body>` tags. If you want to use variables in your email template, you can use handlebars.js syntax and pass the arguments in the request. The variable values will be injected when the email is triggered.\n\nHere’s a sample email with a parameter:\n\n```\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Welcome, {{name}}</h1>\n    <p>We hope you enjoy our super simple emails!</p>\n    <p>Thanks for subscribing!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, `{{name}}` is a variable that will be replaced with the actual name when the email is sent.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Netlify Email Integration documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/email-integration#add-email-templates)."

      "question": " How do I select a protocol for my IoT project?",
      "answer": "Selecting a protocol for your IoT project involves considering several factors:\n\n1. **Networking Technology**: Before starting a wireless design with Silicon Labs' wireless microcontrollers, you should first consider which of the available networking technologies would be most appropriate for your project. This could be Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth mesh, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-SUN, or OpenThread, among others. Each of these technologies has its strengths and use cases, so you need to choose based on your specific project requirements [[source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)].\n\n2. **Multiprotocol Implementation**: Implementing more than one protocol on a single device can lead to cost savings, space savings, and energy savings. This document describes different ways to implement multiprotocol devices and the infrastructure requirements for an effective implementation [[source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-16-multiprotocol-fundamentals.pdf)].\n\n3. **Security**: Security is a crucial aspect of any IoT solution. Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation. Silicon Labs tools are designed to support the various levels of security provided by the protocol in question. You need to review and decide on the level of security required by your specific application and use cases [[source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-03-fundamentals-design-choices.pdf)].\n\n4. **RF Protocol/Technology**: Considerations for selecting the RF protocol/technology are link budget, energy consumption, and cost. You need to determine whether a Sub GHz or 2.4 GHz transceiver will best serve your application needs. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so you need to choose based on your specific project requirements [[source](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/Internet-of-Things-System-Design-with-Integrated-Wireless-MCUs.pdf)].\n\n5. **Protocol-Specific Security References**: Depending on the protocol you choose, there are specific security considerations and resources available. For example, if you choose Bluetooth, there are resources available on designing Bluetooth Low Energy applications with security and privacy in mind, and on certificate-based Bluetooth authentication and pairing. Similarly, for Zigbee, there are resources available on Zigbee security [[source](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/iot-security-protocol-specific)].\n\nRemember, the choice of protocol will largely depend on the specific requirements of your IoT project, such as the data rate, range, power consumption, and security needs."

In this case, it seems like the `@growthbook/growthbook` module is not being recognized. \n\nThere are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Ensure that the `@growthbook/growthbook` package is installed in your project. You can do this by running `npm install @growthbook/growthbook` in your project directory.\n\n2. If the package is installed and you're still facing the issue, it could be due to how you're trying to import the module. If `@growthbook/growthbook` is a CommonJS module, you might need to import it using the `require` syntax or use the default export as suggested in the error message:\n\n```javascript\nimport pkg from '@growthbook/growthbook';\nconst { GrowthBook } = pkg;\n```\nor\n```javascript\nconst { GrowthBook } = require(\"@growthbook/growthbook\");\n```\n\n3. If you're using ES6 modules and you're seeing this error, make sure you have `\"type\": \"module\"` in your `package.json` file.

      "answer": "Yes, there are a few ways to shut down a Ray cluster, including the head node, once a job is done or when the cluster becomes idle.\n\n1. **Ray CLI**: You can use the Ray CLI to shut down the cluster by running the command `ray down cluster.yaml` [^1^]. This command will shut down the entire cluster, including the head node.\n\n2. **Ray Autoscaler**: The Ray Autoscaler can automatically shut down idle nodes after a specified timeout period. This is controlled by the `idle_timeout_minutes` parameter in the cluster YAML configuration [^2^]. However, this might not shut down the head node as it is responsible for managing the cluster and running singleton processes for cluster management [^3^].\n\n3. **Workflow Engine**: For a more robust solution, you can use a workflow engine like Airflow. In a Kubernetes environment, you could run your Ray job submitter in a Kubernetes job and have an operator tear down the cluster when the Kubernetes job completes successfully [^4^].\n\n4. **Ray Serve**: If you're using Ray Serve, you can use the `ray.serve.shutdown()` function to completely shut down Serve on the cluster, which deletes all applications and shuts down Serve system actors [^5^].\n\nRemember that shutting down the cluster will also delete any data stored in the cluster, so make sure to persist any necessary data before shutting down.\n\n[^1^]: [Anyscale Blog - Autoscaling clusters with Ray](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/autoscaling-clusters-with-ray)\n[^2^]: [Anyscale Blog - Autoscaling clusters with Ray](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/autoscaling-clusters-with-ray)\n[^3^]: [Ray Documentation - Key Concepts](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html)\n[^4^]: [Ray Forum - Is there a way to stop or delete the head node once the job is done?](https://discuss.ray.io/t/6370)\n[^5^]: [Ray Documentation - ray.serve.shutdown](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.shutdown.html)"

      "answer": "To make your website responsive for all screens, you can follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Use a Fluid Grid System**: A fluid grid system is crucial for responsive design as it ensures that the layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. Instead of using absolute units like pixels, use relative units such as percentages to create layouts that automatically adjust to the available screen real estate. No-code platforms like Toddle provide drag-and-drop functionality and visual tools to create fluid grid layouts without writing code. [Source](https://toddle.dev/blog/The-Intricacies-of-Responsiveness)\n\n2. **Flexible Images**: Ensuring images scale and resize appropriately is crucial to maintaining a website's visual integrity. Set the image's width to 100% and height to auto, which allows the images to maintain their aspect ratio and ensures they do not exceed their container's dimensions. This approach prevents images from becoming distorted or pixelated as they adapt to different screen sizes. [Source](https://toddle.dev/blog/The-Intricacies-of-Responsiveness)\n\n3. **Use Media Queries**: Media queries, first introduced in CSS3, allow web designers to apply different CSS rules based on specific user device conditions. They provide breakpoint functionality and tailor the website's layout and appearance for various screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations. This fine-tuning ensures that users enjoy a seamless browsing experience, regardless of their device. [Source](https://toddle.dev/blog/The-Intricacies-of-Responsiveness)\n\n4. **Leverage CSS Flexbox**: CSS Flexbox is a layout module in CSS3. It allows you to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. [Source](https://toddle.dev/blog/The-Intricacies-of-Responsiveness)\n\n5. **Use a No-Code Platform**: No-code platforms like Toddle have integrated these responsive design principles to empower non-technical developers to create adaptable websites without writing any code. They provide built-in responsiveness, visual design tools, and customizable options, making responsive design accessible to a broader audience. [Source](https://toddle.dev/blog/The-Intricacies-of-Responsiveness)\n\nRemember, the goal of responsive design is to make your website accessible, visually appealing, and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes."

      "answer": "In the context of Milvus, an open-source vector database, both insert and upsert operations are used to add data, but they function differently.\n\n**Insert**: This operation is used to add new entities (data) into Milvus. An entity in Milvus consists of a group of fields and is used to represent unstructured data like images, magazine articles, short videos, and more. Milvus 2.1 now supports VARCHAR data type on scalar field. You can learn more about inserting data in Milvus [here](https://milvus.io/docs/insert_data.md). \n\n**Upsert**: This operation is a combination of insert and delete operations. In Milvus, an upsert is a data-level operation that will overwrite an existing entity if a specified field already exists in a collection, and insert a new entity if the specified value doesn’t already exist. However, it's important to note that upsert operations may compromise performance because the operation involves deleting data during execution. You can learn more about upserting entities in Milvus [here](https://milvus.io/docs/upsert_entities.md).\n\nIn summary, while both operations can be used to add data, the insert operation is used for definitive insertions, and the upsert operation is used when there is a possibility that the data may already exist in the database. The upsert operation will either update the existing data or insert new data, depending on the situation."

      "question": "What is the recommendation for disk usage?",
      "answer": "EventStoreDB doesn't provide a specific recommendation for disk usage, but it does provide some guidelines and tools to manage it. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Monitor Disk Space**: It's important to keep an eye on available disk space because the nodes cannot function without free disk space. If one node is running out of disk space, typically all are. Disk throughput is also interesting to watch. It may be that the load is not evenly spread across the cluster, or disk throughput is a lot higher or lower than you were expecting. This should be considered in conjunction with the IOPS and throughput limits that your environment may impose on your disk or VM [[source](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/metrics-in-eventstoredb-23.10)].\n\n2. **Consider Disk Size and IOPS Limit**: If you're using Microsoft Azure, be aware that Azure Premium SSD volumes have a strict IOPS limit and this limit depends on the volume size. Very small volumes do not provide enough throughput for most production scenarios. It's suggested to consider using at least 246 GiB disks to get enough IOPS for the database [[source](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/provision#considerations-for-microsoft-azure)].\n\n3. **Manage Stats Collection**: EventStoreDB collects a lot of debug and statistics information which can take up significant disk space. You can decrease the stats collection amount and time range, but you still have to manually initiate scavenge and clean up [[source](https://discuss.eventstore.com/t/2310)].\n\n4. **Scavenge and Clean Up**: If you delete streams/events, make sure to schedule scavenges (one node at a time). There is a tool that allows to do some analysis of the database. It is part of the commercial offering [[source](https://discuss.eventstore.com/t/3045)].\n\n5. **Plan for Growth**: As Event Store operates, the storage footprint will continue to grow. You may need to plan for this growth by partitioning onto multiple disks and/or moving event streams to an archive instance of EventStore [[source](https://discuss.eventstore.com/t/2358)].\n\n6. **Choose the Right Cloud Instance Size**: Event Store Cloud provides different instance sizes with varying disk sizes. Choose the one that fits your needs [[source](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/provision#sizes)].\n\nRemember, these are general guidelines and the specifics may vary depending on your use case and environment."

      "answer": "Based on the knowledge sources provided, it seems like you're encountering a \"Null check operator used on a null value\" error when trying to run your Serverpod project. This error typically occurs when you're trying to access a property or method on a null value.\n\nThe error stack trace you provided indicates that the error is happening when the `DatabaseConfig._fromJson` method is called. This method is likely trying to access a property or method on a null value, which is causing the error.\n\nUnfortunately, the knowledge sources provided do not contain a direct solution to this specific issue. However, they do suggest that similar issues have been encountered by other users in different parts of the Serverpod codebase. For example, similar issues were reported in the `ServerpodConfig` and `Serverpod` classes ([source 1](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues/226), [source 2](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues/747), [source 3](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues/208)).\n\nTo resolve this issue, you might want to check the data being passed to the `DatabaseConfig._fromJson` method and ensure it is not null. If the data is coming from an external source (like a database or API), you should also check that the data source is returning the expected data.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you might want to consider opening an issue on the [Serverpod GitHub page](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues) to get help from the Serverpod community.

      "answer": "Based on the information provided in the knowledge sources, it seems that Alpaca currently does not support placing orders via WebSocket. The current method for placing orders is through the POST method, which establishes a new HTTP connection each time. This has been identified as a potential area for improvement, with suggestions for Alpaca to support placing orders through WebSocket or other binary protocols that keep the connection, thereby reducing latency ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/6557)).\n\nAs for the issue of slippage on TP and SL orders, it's a common problem especially for stocks with low volume. When the market hits either SL or TP, the position is often closed far from the bracket, especially on the SL side. This happens because until SL and TP are converted to market orders and until executed, the market can move far outside of the pre-set bracket limits ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/7232)).\n\nIf you want to receive the filled price of a submitted order, you can use Alpaca's WebSocket for account updates, which will give you the price on the fill ([source](https://forum.alpaca.markets/t/2982)).\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with your orders, it's recommended to reach out to Alpaca's support team for further assistance."

      "question": "I don't understand this : npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql",
      "answer": "The command you're asking about is used to generate a migration file with Prisma Migrate. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n- `npx prisma migrate diff`: This is the main command that tells Prisma to compare two states of your data model and generate a SQL script that transitions from one to the other.\n\n- `--from-empty`: This argument tells Prisma to assume that the data model you're migrating from is empty. In other words, it's as if you're starting from a database with no tables.\n\n- `--to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma`: This argument specifies the current state of your data model. Prisma will look at the schema defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.\n\n- `--script`: This argument tells Prisma to output the result as a SQL script.\n\n- `> prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql`: This part of the command is not actually processed by Prisma. It's a shell command that redirects the output of the previous command to a file. In this case, the SQL script will be saved in the `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` file.\n\nThis command is typically used when you want to baseline your database. Baselining refers to initializing your migration history for a database that might already contain data and cannot be reset, such as your production database. Baselining tells Prisma Migrate to assume that one or more migrations have already been applied to your database[^1^][^2^].\n\n[^1^]: [Source](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/baseline-your-database-node-mysql#create-an-initial-migration)\n[^2^]: [Source](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/baseline-your-database-typescript-postgresql#create-an-initial-migration)"

For newer generations of CPUs, updating your chipset can improve performance. Here are the steps to install chipset drivers:\n\n1. Download [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) to find your motherboard model.\n2. Use Google and search for \"*your motherboard model* support\" and you will find the support page which lists manuals, drivers, BIOS updates and other information.\n3. Find and download your chipset driver from this website.\n4. Open and install the driver and you're finished.\n\nIn case you can't find your chipset driver from your motherboard manufacturer, you can install the generic chipset from your CPU manufacturer. But only follow these steps when you have tried the steps above.\n\nFor AMD:\n1. Open [TechPowerUp's AMD Chipset](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/amd-ryzen-chipset-drivers/) and click the download button.\n2.

However, you're encountering a standalone error.\n\nA standalone error in GDScript usually means that a statement is not doing anything. For example, if you have a variable or a constant on a line by itself, it's not doing anything and GDScript will throw a standalone error.\n\nIn your case, it's hard to determine the exact cause of the error without more context. However, it's important to ensure that the variables `angersound`, `plantsound`, and `fairysound` are defined before they are used in the `sound_data` dictionary. Also, make sure that the `soundscall()` function is being used correctly in your script.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define these variables and use them in your function:\n\n```gdscript\nvar angersound = preload(\"res://path_to_your_anger_sound.ogg\")\nvar plantsound = preload(\"res://path_to_your_plant_sound.ogg\")\nvar fairysound = preload(\"res://path_to_your_fairy_sound.ogg\")\n\nfunc soundscall():\n    var sound_data = {\n        \"anger\": angersound,\n        \"plant\": plantsound,\n        \"fairy\": fairysound\n    }\n    # Use sound_data here...\n```\n\nThis is just a general guidance.

      "answer": "Choosing the right theme for your Shopify store depends on various factors. Here are some steps you can follow to make an informed decision:\n\n1. **Understand your needs**: Identify the features you need for your store. This could include specific design elements, navigation features, or unique selling points. If a theme doesn’t come with a feature that you need, it may require customizations or a third-party APP, which can add considerable expenses[^1^].\n\n2. **Review theme demos**: Carefully review the theme demos and ask the Shopify theme developer to clarify any points that aren’t clear[^1^]. Pay attention to what homepage sections are available in that theme and what settings and options there are for configuring the collection, product, blog, and cart pages[^3^].\n\n3. **Check real-life examples**: Review real shops that are using the theme you’re interested in[^4^]. This will give you a better idea of how the theme looks and functions in a real-world setting.\n\n4. **Consider your audience**: The choice of your theme should also consider your audience. For example, if your store targets a highly tech-savvy audience, they might appreciate innovative features and designs[^5^].\n\n5. **Try before you buy**: Many theme developers offer multiple demo stores for the same theme to illustrate its flexibility. Also, take advantage of the Shopify feature that lets you install a read-only copy of a theme on your store so you can see how it works with your actual products and configurations[^7^].\n\n6. **Consider the reputation of the developer**: Pay close attention to the theme author’s reputation. Look for reviews of both the theme and the theme author, paying close attention to the quality of support[^8^].\n\nRemember, the goal is to make sure you’re getting what you’re expecting. If you have any doubts or questions, you can always ask the theme developer beforehand[^3^].\n\n[^1^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/shopify-theme-checklist)\n[^3^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/selecting-a-shopify-theme)\n[^4^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/shopify-theme-selection)\n[^5^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/high-converting-shopify-themes)\n[^7^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/shopify-theme-shopping-advice-to-ensure-you-get-the-design-and-functionality-you-need)\n[^8^]: (https://outofthesandbox.com/blogs/shopify-theme-blog/48956997-3-tips-for-selecting-the-best-premium-shopify-theme-for-your-store)"

      "answer": "Camunda offers two main deployment options: SaaS (Software as a Service) and Self-Managed.\n\n**Camunda SaaS** is a cloud-based service where Camunda handles the management of the resources needed for the performance and throughput of the platform. This includes the deployment of the Zeebe broker, an elastic database for Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize, and the Java applications for Optimize, Operate, and Tasklist. This option provides peace of mind as Camunda does the heavy lifting and provides everything as a service for you, allowing you to concentrate on your important work. Enterprise SaaS plans are tailored to your needs, and for more specific details, it's recommended to reach out to the enterprise team [here](https://camunda.com/platform/camunda-platform-enterprise-contact/). For local development purposes, developers could also create a cluster for development purposes in the SaaS offering of Camunda. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#camunda-deployment)\n\n**Camunda Self-Managed** is an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, where you host it yourself. This setup is highly customizable and can be deployed in different setups. The components available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed include Zeebe, Zeebe Gateway, Operate, Tasklist, Connectors, Optimize, Identity (not available in Camunda 8 SaaS), and Web Modeler (Enterprise only). Users may also use Desktop Modeler as an addition to these components. For deployment, Helm/Kubernetes is the recommended method, especially in production. Each component of Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed in single or high-availability mode, which provides minimal to no service interruption. [source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/about-self-managed)\n\nThe choice between SaaS and Self-Managed depends on your specific needs and resources. If you prefer to have more control over the deployment and management of the platform, Self-Managed might be the better option. If you prefer to have the management handled by Camunda, then the SaaS option would be more suitable. [source](https://forum.camunda.io/t/48042)"

Each entity also requires a repository to be created ([source](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/overview)).\n\nRepositories, on the other hand, provide generic helper methods for entities. For example, you can use the `find` method to retrieve all entities with pagination, or `findOne` to retrieve a single entity record. Repositories are Typeorm repositories, so you can refer to Typeorm's documentation on all available methods ([source](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/repositories)).\n\nIf you want to add custom methods or override existing methods in a repository, you can create a custom repository. However, the creation of an entity should be handled separately, and not within the repository ([source](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/repositories#create-custom-repository)). \n\nSo, while you can extend repositories to add new methods or override existing ones, the creation of an entity should be handled in the entity itself, not in the repository."

      "question": "When viewing my heap memory, should I be worried with it reaches 90%?",
      "answer": "Yes, you should be concerned if your heap memory usage reaches 90%. Hazelcast recommends keeping some memory headroom available to handle any member failure or explicit member shutdown. When a member leaves the cluster, the data previously owned by the newly offline member will be redistributed across the remaining members. For this reason, Hazelcast recommends that you plan to use only 60% of available memory, with 40% headroom to handle member failure or shutdown. \n\nIf you're using the High-Density Memory Store, Hazelcast automatically assigns a percentage of available off-heap memory to the internal memory manager. By default, this property is set to 12.5%. If you want to be informed about how much off-heap memory is being used by the memory manager, you can set the metadata-space-percentage property to a percentage value and Hazelcast will log warnings when that value is reached.\n\nIn addition, the best way to minimize the performance impact of Garbage Collection (GC) is to keep heap usage small. Maintaining a small heap saves countless hours of GC tuning and provides improved stability and predictability across your entire application. \n\nYou can monitor your heap memory distribution through the Hazelcast Management Center. It provides a quick view of how much free heap memory is available to the cluster, including the percentage of heap memory that contains map data structures, other data structures, and free memory.\n\nSources:\n- [Memory Considerations](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/capacity-planning#memory-considerations)\n- [Minimize Heap Usage](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/cluster-performance/performance-tuning#minimize-heap-usage)\n- [Heap Memory Distribution](https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/latest/clusters/dashboard#heap-memory-distribution)"

      "answer": "Sure, here's an example of how you can use `JsonOutputParser` for a single LLM call in JavaScript. In this case, you should import it from `langchain/output_parsers`.\n\n```javascript\nimport { JsonOutputToolsParser } from \"langchain/output_parsers\";  \nimport { ChatPromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";  \nimport { ChatOpenAI } from \"@langchain/openai\";  \n\n// Define your prompt template\nconst template = `Answer the following user question to the best of your ability:  \n{format_instructions}  \n{question}`;  \n\n// Create a prompt from the template\nconst prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template);  \n\n// Initialize the model\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({});  \n\n// Initialize the output parser\nconst outputParser = new JsonOutputToolsParser();  \n\n// Create a chain with the prompt, model, and output parser\nconst chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(outputParser);  \n\n// Define your user query\nconst userQuery = {\n question: \"how are you?\",  \n format_instructions: outputParser.getFormatInstructions(),  \n};\n\n// Invoke the chain with the user query\nconst result = await chain.invoke(userQuery);  \n\n// Print the result\nconsole.log(result);  \n```\n\nIn this example, `JsonOutputToolsParser` is used to parse the output of the LLM into a JSON object. The `pipe` method is used to chain the prompt, model, and output parser together. The `invoke` method is used to run the chain with a user query, and the result is then printed out ([source](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/custom))."

      "answer": "In Camunda, `zeebe:input` and `zeebe:taskHeader` are used to define different aspects of a task.\n\n`zeebe:input` is used to define the input parameters for a task. These parameters can be filled in at runtime and are used to pass data into the task. For example, in a connector, you might define input parameters like \"Year\" and \"Country Code\" that are required for the task to run correctly. Here is an example of how `zeebe:input` might be used:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"label\": \"Year\",\n   \"description\": \"Define the year\",\n   \"group\": \"input\",\n   \"type\": \"String\",\n   \"feel\": \"optional\",\n   \"binding\": {\n     \"type\": \"zeebe:input\",\n     \"name\": \"year\"\n   },\n   \"constraints\": {\n     \"pattern\": {\n       \"value\": \"^(19[3-9][0-9]|20[0-9][0-9]|2099)$|(=.+)\",\n       \"message\": \"Year must be between 1930 to 2099\"\n     }\n   },\n   \"optional\": false\n}\n```\n(Source: [Integrate External Systems Effortlessly with Custom Connectors in Camunda Platform](https://camunda.com/blog/2023/04/create-custom-template-based-on-rest-connector#h.20a5vlfuzh4v))\n\nOn the other hand, `zeebe:taskHeader` is used to configure a task header. Task headers are used to pass static parameters to the job worker. For example, you might use a task header to pass the key of the decision to evaluate. Here is how `zeebe:taskHeader` is defined:\n\n| **Binding `type`** | `zeebe:taskHeader` |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Valid property `type`'s** | `String` `Text``Hidden``Dropdown` |\n| **Binding parameters** | `key`: The key of the task header |\n| **Mapping result** | `&lt;zeebe:header key=&quot;[key]&quot; value=&quot;[userInput] /&gt;` |\n\n(Source: [Defining template properties](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/defining-templates#zeebetaskheader))\n\nIn summary, `zeebe:input` is used to define dynamic input parameters for a task, while `zeebe:taskHeader` is used to define static parameters that are passed to the job worker."

The error message you're seeing suggests that there might be an issue with the way you're exporting your component or the types you're using.\n\nIn Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name. \n\nHere is an example of a simple page component in Next.js:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <div>Hello World</div>\n}\n```\n\nIn your case, you're exporting a component `HospitalRecordPage` that accepts a prop `id`. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the way you're exporting your component or the types you're using.\n\n```jsx\nconst HospitalRecordPage = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nexport default HospitalRecordPage;\n```\n\nThis looks correct as per the standard React and TypeScript syntax. However, if you're using this component as a Next.js page, you might need to adjust how you're passing the `id` prop. In Next.js, page components get their data passed in a different way, usually through a function like `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or `getInitialProps`.\n\nIf you're still facing issues, it would be helpful to check the version of Next.js you're using.

      "answer": "The error you're encountering, \"429 Too Many Requests\", is a common HTTP status code indicating that you have sent too many requests in a given amount of time to the OpenAI API. \n\nIn the LlamaIndex library, the `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents()` function is used to create an index from the documents. This function internally makes requests to the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for the documents. If you're processing a large number of documents, this could lead to a high rate of requests to the OpenAI API, causing the 429 error.\n\nTo control the rate of requests to the OpenAI API, you can adjust the `chunk_size` parameter in the `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents()` function. This parameter controls the number of documents that are processed in a single batch. By reducing the `chunk_size`, you can reduce the rate of requests to the OpenAI API.\n\nHere's an example of how you can adjust the `chunk_size`:\n\n```python\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir=\"./content\",recursive=True).load_data(num_workers=10)\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, chunk_size=512)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `chunk_size` is set to 512, meaning that 512 documents will be processed in a single batch. You can adjust this value based on your needs and the rate limits of the OpenAI API.\n\nPlease note that the rate limits for the OpenAI API depend on your specific API key and the type of API you're using. You may need to contact OpenAI support for more information on your specific rate limits.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/output_parsing/LangchainOutputParserDemo.html) and the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-reference-guide)."

It's possible that the timeout is set to a high value, which could be causing the delay. The default timeout is usually 100 seconds.\n\n## Step 2: Check Network and Service Execution Time\nNext, we should consider factors such as network and service execution time. These factors can significantly impact the agent connection time.\n\n## Step 3: Upgrade Leapwork Build\nIf you're using an older version of Leapwork, I recommend upgrading to the latest build. This could potentially resolve the issue as newer builds often contain performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n## Step 4: Provide System Configurations and Log Analysis\nFor further investigation, we would need more information about your system configurations and a log analysis. This will help us identify any specific issues that might be causing the slow connection times.\n\n## Step 5: Test in Different Environments\nIf possible, try to test the agent connection times in different environments. This can help us determine if the issue is specific to a certain environment or if it's a more general problem.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide us with more details about your setup, such as the Leapwork version you're using, your network setup, and any error messages you're seeing.

      "answer": "The error message \"PrismaClientValidationError: Invalid client engine type, please use `library` or `binary`\" indicates that the Prisma Client is trying to use an engine type that it was not generated with. \n\nIn Prisma, you can configure the query engine type by providing the `engineType` property to the Prisma Client `generator`. Valid values for `engineType` are `binary` and `library`. Here is an example of how to set it:\n\n```prisma\ngenerator client { \n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\" \n  engineType = \"binary\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the environment variable `PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE` to set the engine type. \n\nIf you're still facing this issue, it might be due to the client being generated on one platform and used on a different one, incorrect `binaryTargets` being set, or issues with bundling or deployment not copying the engine correctly. \n\nIf you're facing this issue in a specific setup like a Turborepo or when connecting to a remote DB from a local environment, it would be helpful to provide more details about the steps you took and any commands you ran along the way. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#defining-the-query-engine-type-for-prisma-client) or the related [Github issues](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21428) discussing similar problems."

      "answer": "It seems like you're experiencing an issue where Google Ads are not rendering correctly when navigating between pages using Next.js's soft navigation. This is a known issue with scripts in Next.js, as they may lose their state during client-side navigation.\n\nOne of the users in a [Github issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/55191) faced a similar problem and found a workaround by restructuring their code. They created separate layouts for different parts of their site, effectively isolating the scripts and preventing them from losing their state during navigation.\n\nHere's how they restructured their code:\n\n```bash\nsrc/\n    app/\n       (default_site)/\n            about/page.tsx\n            contact/page.tsx\n            layout.tsx\n       (error_layout)/\n            [...not_found]/page.tsx\n            layout.tsx\n            not-found.tsx\n   components/\n   utils/\n```\n\nIn this structure, they have two `layout.tsx` files, each containing a root layout for different parts of the site. For example, `layout.tsx` in `(default_site)/` contains the global AdSense Code with Google Analytics. But the error page like 404 Page only contains Google Analytics and there is no AdSense code there at all.\n\nThis approach might help you maintain the state of your Google Ads script during navigation. However, please note that this is a workaround and may not be the ideal solution for all use cases."

      "question": "When to implement custom assignment event",
      "answer": "Amplitude's platform automatically tracks assignment events as a result of either remote evaluation or local evaluation using a server-side SDK configured for automatic assignment tracking. These assignment events are used as a heuristic exposure event for server-side experiments, to monitor a flag or experiment while active, and to debug any issues. Therefore, you typically wouldn't need to track assignment events manually ([source](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/experiment/general/experiment-event-tracking#assignment-events)).\n\nHowever, in the context of local evaluation using the PHP SDK, you can configure the local evaluation client to send assignment events to Amplitude. This is done using an AssignmentTrackingProvider, which the local evaluation client uses to send assignment events to Amplitude. The local evaluation client calls `track()` when it determines there are untracked assignment events ([source](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/experiment/sdks/php-sdk#assignment-tracking)).\n\n```php\ninterface AssignmentTrackingProvider {\n  public function track(Assignment $assignment): void;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, you might implement a custom assignment event if you want to use a custom provider for increased flexibility and performance. However, Amplitude generally recommends using the default assignment tracking provider, especially for testing due to its synchronous nature.\n\nRemember, the decision to implement a custom assignment event should be based on your specific needs and comfort level with the Amplitude platform."

      "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble mining Tari. Let's try to troubleshoot this issue.\n\nFirstly, ensure that all the required applications are running. For SHA3 mining, you need to have the Minotari Base Node, Minotari Wallet, and Minotari Miner running. For merge mining with Monero, you need the Minotari Base Node, Minotari Wallet, Minotari Merge Mining Proxy, XMRig, and a Monero wallet. \n\nFor SHA3 mining, you should look out for the following types of messages on the Tari Miner console to confirm that it is connected properly and performing mining:\n\n```\n2021-02-26 11:24:23.604202000 [minotari_miner] INFO  Connecting to base node at http://127.0.0.1:18151\n2021-02-26 11:24:23.606260800 [minotari_miner] INFO  Connecting to wallet at http://127.0.0.1:18161\n2021-02-26 11:24:23.721890400 [minotari_miner::miner] INFO  Mining thread 0 started\n2021-02-26 11:24:23.722287800 [minotari_miner::miner] INFO  Mining thread 1 started\n2021-02-26 11:24:23.722505500 [minotari_miner::miner] INFO  Mining thread 2 started\n2021-02-26 11:28:19.687855700 [minotari_miner::miner] INFO  Mining thread 2 stopped\n2021-02-26 11:28:19.688251200 [minotari_miner] INFO  Miner 2 found block header BlockHeader { hash: [...], version: 1,\n  height: 8493, prev_hash: [...], timestamp: Some(Timestamp { seconds: 1614331698, nanos: 0 }), output_mr: [...],\n  witness_mr: [...], total_kernel_offset: [...], nonce: 8415580256943728281, pow: Some(ProofOfWork { pow_algo: 2,\n  pow_data: [] }), kernel_mmr_size: 24983, output_mmr_size: 125474 } with difficulty 7316856839\n```\n\nIf you don't see these messages, there might be an issue with your setup. Make sure that you have started all the required applications in the correct order. \n\nFor merge mining, ensure that you have a Monero wallet address for the Monero network you want to use. You can use a public stagenet address or a public mainnet address.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, it might be helpful to revisit the installation and setup instructions to make sure you didn't miss any steps.

      "question": "Objects vs instances",
      "answer": "In the context of Encord, an **object** is something of interest in a frame, defined by string together with an annotation. It can be used as part of an ontology to label entities of interest in a dataset used for model training. Examples include bounding boxes and polygons that have been applied to a frame. Objects are also part of the instantiated objects and classifications in a given data asset, grouped first by class, and sorted by creation time within each class, with earlier objects on top. They are named in an \"ABC (0)\" format, where ABC is the ontology class and 0 is the first instance annotation [source](https://docs.encord.com/docs/annotate-glossary).\n\nAn **instance**, on the other hand, is a specific occurrence of a class. For example, Car(0) is an instance of the Car class, it could be a specific black sedan. The single Car(0) instance can appear in a single frame or a range of frames. Therefore, instances may contain multiple labels across frames. Instances are also unique instantiations of an ontology entity, which, depending on the data type, may contain many frame labels [source](https://docs.encord.com/docs/annotate-annotation-projects).\n\nIn summary, an object is a general term for something of interest in a frame that can be used as part of an ontology to label entities of interest, while an instance is a specific occurrence of a class, which can appear in a single frame or a range of frames and may contain multiple labels."

      "question": "I am getting an error from my payment processor after calling the authorize payment method in the payment processor. Error: payment method is not authorized",
      "answer": "The error you're encountering suggests that the payment authorization process is not successful. In Medusa, the `authorizePayment` method is used to authorize payment using the Payment Session of an order. This method is called when the cart is completed and before the order is created. It's also used for authorizing payments of a swap of an order and when authorizing sessions in a payment collection.\n\nThe payment authorization might require additional action from the customer before it is declared authorized. Once that additional action is performed, the `authorizePayment` method will be called again to validate that the payment is now fully authorized. If the payment authorization fails, then an error will be thrown and the order will not be created.\n\nThe payment authorization status is determined using the `getPaymentStatus` method. If the status is `requires_more`, then it means additional actions are required from the customer. If you try to create the order with a status that isn't `authorized`, the process will fail.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement the `authorizePayment` method:\n\n```javascript\nimport {  \n PaymentProcessorError,  \n PaymentSessionStatus,  \n // ...  \n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"  \n// ...  \n  \nclass MyPaymentService extends AbstractPaymentProcessor {  \n // ...  \n async authorizePayment(  \n paymentSessionData: Record<string, unknown>,  \n context: Record<string, unknown>  \n ): Promise<  \n PaymentProcessorError |  \n {  \n status: PaymentSessionStatus;  \n data: Record<string, unknown>;  \n }  \n > {  \n try {  \n await this.client.authorize(paymentSessionData.id)  \n  \n return {  \n status: PaymentSessionStatus.AUTHORIZED,  \n data: {  \n id: paymentSessionData.id  \n }  \n }  \n } catch (e) {  \n return {  \n error: e.message  \n }  \n }  \n }  \n}  \n```\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, it might be worth checking your payment processor's configuration in your `medusa-config.js` file and ensuring that it's correctly installed and enabled in your region.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [authorizePayment method](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/medusa/interfaces/medusa.PaymentProcessor#authorizepayment)\n- [Adding payment processors](https://docs.medusajs.com/troubleshooting/missing-payment-providers)"

      "question": "raw data json vs normalized tabular data",
      "answer": "In Airbyte, you have the option to choose between two types of data processing for every connection: Raw Data (JSON) and Normalized Tabular Data.\n\n**Raw Data (JSON):**\nIn this option, Airbyte places the JSON blob version of your data in a table called `_airbyte_raw_<stream name>`. Your data will be written to your destination as one data column with a JSON blob that contains all of your data. This is in line with the core tenet of ELT philosophy that data should be untouched as it moves through the E and L stages so that the raw data is always accessible. If an unmodified version of the data exists in the destination, it can be retransformed without needing to sync data again. If you don't enable Basic Normalization, you'll have to transform the JSON data from that column yourself [[source](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/basic-normalization#high-level-overview)].\n\n**Normalized Tabular Data (Basic Normalization):**\nWhen basic normalization is enabled, Airbyte transforms data after the sync in a step called `Basic Normalization`, which structures data from the source into a format appropriate for consumption in the destination. For example, when writing data from a nested, dynamically typed source like a JSON API to a relational destination like Postgres, normalization is the process which un-nests JSON from the source into a relational table format which uses the appropriate column types in the destination. If you have Basic Normalization enabled, Airbyte automatically uses this JSON blob to create a schema and tables with your data in mind, converting it to the format of your destination. This runs after your sync and may take a long time if you have a large amount of data synced [[source](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/basic-normalization#high-level-overview)].\n\nFor example, if a source emits data that looks like this:\n```\n{  \n \"make\": \"alfa romeo\",  \n \"model\": \"4C coupe\",  \n \"horsepower\": \"247\"  \n}  \n```\nThe destination connectors produce the following raw table in the destination database:\n```\nCREATE TABLE \"_airbyte_raw_cars\" (  \n \"_airbyte_ab_id\" VARCHAR, \n \"_airbyte_emitted_at\" TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE, \n \"_airbyte_data\" JSONB \n);  \n```\nThen, basic normalization would create the following table:\n```\nCREATE TABLE \"cars\" (  \n \"_airbyte_ab_id\" VARCHAR,  \n \"_airbyte_emitted_at\" TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE,  \n \"_airbyte_cars_hashid\" VARCHAR,  \n \"_airbyte_normalized_at\" TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE,  \n \"make\" VARCHAR,  \n \"model\" VARCHAR,  \n \"horsepower\" INTEGER  \n);  \n```\n[[source](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/core-concepts/basic-normalization#example)].\n\nPlease note that not all destinations support normalization."

      "answer": "When designing a database for high performance and availability, there are several best practices you can follow:\n\n1. **Use Application Patterns**: Running applications in multiple data centers with data split across them is not a trivial task. When designing global applications, choose a suitable design pattern for your application from a suite of battle-tested design paradigms. These include Global database, Multi-master, Standby cluster, Duplicate indexes, Follower reads, and more. You can also combine these patterns as per your needs. For more details, see [Build global applications](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/build-global-apps \"Build global applications\").\n\n2. **Colocation**: Colocated tables optimize latency and performance for data access by reducing the need for additional trips across the network for small tables. Additionally, it reduces the overhead of creating a tablet for every relation (tables, indexes, and so on) and their storage per node. For more details, see [colocation](https://docs.yugabyte.com/architecture/docdb-sharding/colocated-tables/ \"colocation\").\n\n3. **Use Prepared Statements**: Whenever possible, use prepared statements to ensure that YugabyteDB partition-aware drivers can route queries to the tablet leader, to improve throughput, and eliminate the need for a server to parse the query on each operation. \n\nThese practices are particularly relevant for YugabyteDB, a high-performance distributed SQL database. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [YugabyteDB Best Practices](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/develop/best-practices-ysql) documentation."

Prisma Client not initializing: This can happen because AWS Elastic Beanstalk doesn't install `devDependencies`, which means that it doesn't pick up the Prisma CLI. You can either add the `prisma` CLI package to your `dependencies` instead of the `devDependencies` or install your `devDependencies` on AWS Elastic Beanstalk instances by setting the AWS Elastic Beanstalk `NPM_USE_PRODUCTION` environment property to false.

      "answer": "There could be several reasons why the number of events in Mixpanel does not match the number of exported events to your destination. Here are a few possible causes:\n\n1. **Data Sync**: If Data Sync is not enabled or not supported for your pipeline, this could lead to discrepancies. Data Sync helps keep the data fresh and minimizes missing data points. However, it does not fully guarantee syncing GDPR Data Deletions. It may take more than 2 days for the data in the destination to be in sync with the data in Mixpanel. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-pipelines/schematized-export-pipeline)\n\n2. **Data Delay**: It can take up to 1 day for late arriving data to be synced from Mixpanel to your destination. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-pipelines/overview)\n\n3. **Hidden Events**: Mixpanel exports all events to your destination, even ones that are hidden in the UI via Lexicon. It's recommended to check whether the count in your destination is mostly due to events that have been hidden in the Mixpanel UI. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-pipelines/overview)\n\nIf you're still experiencing discrepancies, it's recommended to drill down into the data, for example into one day that shows the biggest discrepancies. You can also compare the total event count versus the unique user count in the affected systems. If the totals match, but the unique user count shows discrepancies, it likely points to an ID management issue. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/debugging/overview)\n\nIf the discrepancy is between Mixpanel and another source, but you're tracking via Segment in cloud-mode, you can do the following to troubleshoot:\n- If Segment and Mixpanel show the same data, reach out to Segment Support, as this likely points to an issue with Segment tracking.\n- If Mixpanel and Segment don’t show the same data, and both have a discrepancy with a third source, also reach out to Segment Support to troubleshoot the discrepancy.

Updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities and help protect your store from attacks. Enable automatic updates for WordPress core and regularly check for and install updates for WooCommerce and all plugins. [source](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/docs/security/security-best-practices.md)\n\n2. **Choose secure plugins and themes**: Install plugins and themes from reputable sources, such as the WordPress Plugin Directory and Theme Directory. Regularly review and update the plugins and themes you use, removing any that are no longer maintained or have known security vulnerabilities. Avoid using nulled or pirated plugins and themes, which may contain malicious code. [source](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/docs/security/security-best-practices.md)\n\n3. **Implement secure coding practices**: Follow the WordPress Coding Standards when developing custom themes or plugins. Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection attacks. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update your custom code to address potential security vulnerabilities. [source](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/docs/security/security-best-practices.md)\n\n4. **Harden WordPress security**: Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. Limit login attempts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect against brute-force attacks. Change the default \"wp_\" table prefix in your WordPress database. Disable XML-RPC and REST API access when not needed. Keep file permissions secure and restrict access to sensitive files and directories. [source](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/docs/security/security-best-practices.md)\n\n5. **Secure user data**: Use SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted between your store and your customers.

It can be used to group elements for styling purposes or because they share attribute values. It should be used when no other semantic element (like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.) is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the `<main>` tag is used to encapsulate the main content of a document or an application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application. A document mustn't have more than one `<main>` element that doesn't have the `hidden` attribute specified.\n\nIn the context of Toddle, a no-code developer platform, both `<div>` and `<main>` can be used to structure and style your web application.

      "answer": "In BanyanDB, part of the SkyWalking project, `Stream` and `Measure` are two different approaches for handling data, each with different levels of index granularity.\n\n`Measure` is used for indexing data points with specific tag values. The query processor uses the tag values defined in the `entity` field of the Measure to compose a series ID, which is used to find the several series that match the query criteria. The `entity` field is a set of tags that defines the unique identity of a time series, and it restricts the tags that can be used as indexed target. Each series contains a sequence of data points that share the same tag values. Once the query processor has identified the relevant series, it scans the data points between the desired time range in those series to find the data that matches the query criteria. The side effect of the measure index is that each indexed value has to represent a unique seriesID. This is because the series ID is constructed by concatenating the indexed tag values in the `entity` field. If two series have the same `entity` field, they would have the same series ID and would be indistinguishable from one another. This means that if you want to index a tag that is not part of the `entity` field, you would need to ensure that it is unique across all series. One way to do this would be to include the tag in the `entity` field, but this may not always be feasible or desirable depending on your use case. [source](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/skywalking-banyandb/latest/concept/data-model#index-granularity)\n\nOn the other hand, `Stream` focuses on high throughput data collection, for example, tracing and logging. The database engine also supports compressing stream entries based on `entity`, but no encoding process is involved. For `Stream`, the indexed target is an element that is a combination of the series ID and timestamp. The `Stream` query processor uses the time range to find target files. The indexed result points to the target element. The processor doesn’t have to scan a series of elements in this time range, which reduces the query time. [source](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/skywalking-banyandb/latest/concept/data-model#streams)\n\nIn terms of performance and flexibility, `Measure` indices are faster and more efficient, but they require more care when indexing tags that are not part of the `entity` field. `Stream` indices, on the other hand, are slower and take up more space, but they can index any tag value and do not have the same side effects as `Measure` indices.

      "question": "camunda 7 vs camunda 8",
      "answer": "Camunda 7 and Camunda 8 (also known as Zeebe) have several key differences:\n\n1. **Embedded Engine**: Camunda 7 allows embedding the workflow engine as a library in your application, meaning both run in the same JVM, share thread pools, and can even use the same data source and transaction manager. In contrast, the workflow engine in Camunda 8 is always a remote resource for your application, and the embedded engine mode is not supported [[source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#conceptual-differences)].\n\n2. **Deployment**: The deployment of the workflow engine itself looks different because the workflow engine is no longer embedded into your own deployment artifacts. With Camunda 8, you deploy your Spring Boot application with all custom code and the Zeebe client embedded. This application is typically scaled to at least two instances (for resilience). The Zeebe broker is typically scaled to at least three instances (for resilience). Camunda 8 deployments happen within Kubernetes [[source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#camunda-deployment)].\n\n3. **Programming Model**: The programming models of Camunda 7 and Camunda 8 are very similar if you program in Java and use Spring. However, the application code needs to use a different client library and different APIs, which will lead to code changes you must implement [[source](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#programming-model)].\n\n4. **Database**: Camunda 7 bases all the data access to a relational database, while Camunda 8 stores everything itself on disk, and does replication, and a couple of other things itself.

      "answer": "The RudderStack JavaScript SDK v3 is a new, optimized version of the SDK. It's lighter, more efficient, and offers several benefits over the previous version. Some of these benefits include a smaller size (around 25KB, which is approximately 30% less than the previous version), faster and more reliable performance, less vulnerability to adblockers, and the ability to load specific SDK features using plugins. It also has an improved data encryption technique that results in a lighter storage footprint.\n\nHowever, please note that the SDK v3 is currently in beta. Therefore, you should review the [breaking changes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/v3/#breaking-changes) before you start using it.\n\nOne of the significant changes in the JavaScript SDK v3 is the default source configuration host, which has changed from `rudderlabs.com` to `rudderstack.com`. This means you must proxy `https://api.rudderstack.com` instead of `https://api.rudderlabs.com`.\n\nAlso, the SDK loading snippet, the file name, and the NPM package have changed in the new version. The file name has changed from `rudder-analytics.min.js` to `rsa.min.js`, and the NPM package has changed from `rudder-sdk-js` to `@rudderstack/analytics-js`.\n\nFor more detailed information on using the new SDK, you can refer to the [JavaScript SDK v3 documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/v3/)."

      "question": " parallel commit vs group commit",
      "answer": "I'm sorry, but the provided knowledge sources do not contain specific information comparing parallel commits and group commits in the context of CockroachDB. \n\nHowever, I can provide some information on parallel commits based on the provided sources. Parallel Commits is an optimized atomic commit protocol in CockroachDB that reduces the commit latency of a transaction in half, from two rounds of consensus down to one. This is achieved by allowing the transaction coordinator to return to the client eagerly when it knows that the writes in the transaction have succeeded. The transaction coordinator can then set the transaction record's state to `COMMITTED` and resolve the transaction's write intents asynchronously. This feature is particularly beneficial for improving the speed of transactions in distributed SQL deployments. For more details, you can refer to the [CockroachDB documentation on Parallel Commits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/transaction-layer#parallel-commits).\n\nAs for group commits, I would recommend checking the official CockroachDB documentation or forums for more specific information."

      "answer": "LlamaIndex uses different types of stores to manage and manipulate data. These include Document Stores, Index Stores, and Vector Stores. \n\n- **Document Stores**: These are used to store documents in LlamaIndex. You can customize the underlying storage with a one-line change to instantiate different document stores. More details can be found in the [Document Stores Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/docstores.html).\n\n- **Index Stores**: These are used to store indexes in LlamaIndex. Like document stores, you can customize the underlying storage to instantiate different index stores. More details can be found in the [Index Stores Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/index_stores.html).\n\n- **Vector Stores**: These are a key component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and are used in nearly every application you make using LlamaIndex, either directly or indirectly. Vector stores accept a list of Node objects and build an index from them. Many vector stores will store both the data as well as the index (embeddings). This means that you will not need to use a separate document store or index store. More details can be found in the [Vector Stores Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/vector_stores.html).\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a storage context using default stores:\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core.storage.docstore import SimpleDocumentStore\nfrom llama_index.core.storage.index_store import SimpleIndexStore\nfrom llama_index.core.vector_stores import SimpleVectorStore\nfrom llama_index.core import StorageContext\n\n# create storage context using default stores\nstorage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(\n    docstore=SimpleDocumentStore(),\n    vector_store=SimpleVectorStore(),\n    index_store=SimpleIndexStore(),\n)\n```\nMore details on customization/persistence can be found in the [Customizing Storage Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/customization.html) and the [Persisting & Loading Data Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/storing/save_load.html)."

      "answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain.\n\nIn Mixpanel, there are two types of retention calculations: \"On\" and \"On or After\". These calculations are used to understand how users interact with your product over time.\n\n1. **\"On\" Retention**: This calculates the percentage of users who come back on a specific time unit (e.g. day, week, month). After a user completes the “A criteria” (an action you're tracking), they belong to a time unit cohort that corresponds with when they did the \"A event\" and the Retention report starts counting from the time that particular user performed that \"A event\". For this type of retention, the user must return to fulfill the “came back and did B criteria” on a specific and exact time unit relative to when they did the A criteria to be counted as retained. For example, day 5 retention is the percentage of users who “came back and did B” exactly on the fifth day after they did the A event. \"On\" retention is useful to understand high-level usage patterns and is recommended when your product relies on users returning in each and every time unit. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/retention)\n\n2. **\"On or After\" Retention**: This calculates the percentage of users who come back on a specific time unit (e.g. day, week, month) or any time unit afterward. A user can fulfill the \"came back and did B criteria\" on a specific time unit or any time in the future to be counted as retained in \"On or After\" Retention. This gives you a better sense of how long you are holding on to your users in an absolute sense. It will tell you how many users used your app and then ever returned to find more value. In other words, it's the opposite of the overall churn of your user base. \"On or After\" retention is a better fit for most businesses and it is the default calculation for the Retention report. [source](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/retention)\n\nIn summary, \"On\" retention is about understanding high-level usage patterns and when users regularly use the product, while \"On or After\" retention is more about understanding how many users return to find value from the product, regardless of the specific timing of their return."

      "answer": "The choice between using S3-Glue and S3 as a destination in Airbyte depends on your specific use case and requirements. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Data Querying**: If you plan to query your data using a query engine that can read from AWS Glue Data Catalog, then S3-Glue could be a good choice. The Glue Data Catalog is a managed service that lets you store, annotate, and share metadata in the AWS Cloud ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-glue#step-2-set-up-glue)).\n\n2. **Data Serialization**: S3-Glue allows you to specify a Glue serialization library, which your query engine will use for reading and writing data in your data lake ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-glue#step-3-set-up-the-s3-glue-destination-connector-in-airbyte)).\n\n3. **Data Organization**: Both S3 and S3-Glue allow you to specify a bucket path, which is equivalent to having separate namespaces. However, each stream is written to its own directory under the bucket in the case of S3-Glue ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-glue#supported-sync-modes)).\n\n4. **Sync Modes**: Both S3 and S3-Glue support Full Refresh Sync and Incremental - Append Sync. However, they do not support Incremental - Append + Deduped and Namespaces ([source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-glue#supported-sync-modes)).\n\nRemember to consider your specific needs and constraints when choosing between these two options."

      "answer": "Based on the information from the provided knowledge sources, the performance of blob storage in Nexus Repository can vary depending on whether you're using Amazon S3 or EFS (Elastic File System). \n\nWhen using Amazon S3 for blob storage, the performance is highly dependent on the speed of the network between Nexus Repository and the AWS endpoint to which you connect. Nexus Repository will send multiple outbound HTTP requests to AWS to store blobs in S3, and large blobs are split into chunks over multiple requests. If your Nexus Repository instance is not in AWS or is connecting to a different region, an S3 blob store may be significantly slower than a file-based blob store. It's also recommended that the S3 blob store should be in the same AWS region as the Nexus Repository installation to avoid slow performance[^1^][^5^].\n\nOn the other hand, EFS is file I/O based and in some cases, it has been observed to perform better than S3 which is network I/O based[^2^]. In one instance, a user reported that the initial build time was 2 minutes longer with S3 compared to EFS[^2^]. In another case, a user reported that the load times for resolving dependencies increased from an average of 10-15 seconds to 5 minutes in some cases after migrating from EFS to S3[^6^].\n\nHowever, the choice between S3 and EFS should be based on your specific performance requirements and the environment in which your Nexus Repository is hosted[^2^][^4^].\n\n[^1^]: [En > Storage Planning > Blob Store Types > S3 Blob Store](https://help.sonatype.com/en/storage-planning.html)\n[^2^]: [Zendesk Ticket (closed): Re: Blobstores for maven proxy stored on S3 are slow Part 2](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/73587)\n[^4^]: [Zendesk Ticket (closed): Nexus 3 Performance Check Part 2](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/85606)\n[^5^]: [Zendesk Ticket (closed): AWS S3 best practice Part 2](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/84106)\n[^6^]: [Zendesk Ticket (closed): Blobstores for maven proxy stored on S3 are slow Part 1](https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/71782)"

It is a list of node IDs and their corresponding IP addresses that your node will maintain a persistent connection with. This means that even if the connection to these peers is lost, your node will continually try to reestablish the connection. Here is an example of how to set `persistent_peers`:\n\n```bash\npersistent_peers = \"4ab030b7fd75ed895c48bcc899b99c17a396736b@137.184.190.127:26656,3dbffa30baab16cc8597df02945dcee0aa0a4581@143.198.139.33:26656\"\n```\n(Source: [Initialize Osmosis Node](https://docs.osmosis.zone/overview/validate/joining-testnet#initialize-osmosis-node))\n\nOn the other hand, `addrbook.json` is a file that is automatically generated and maintained by your node.

      "answer": "In DHIS2, the category model is used to provide a fine-grained breakdown of the dimension describing the event being counted. It consists of four main elements: category options, categories, category combinations, and category option combinations.\n\n1. **Category Options**: These are the fine-grained attributes which are related in some common way. For instance, in the context of collecting data on \"Malaria cases\" broken down by gender and age groups, the category options would correspond to “Female”, “Male” and “< 5 years” and “> 5 years”.\n\n2. **Categories**: Categories are used to group related category options according to a common theme. In the example above, the categories would correspond to “Gender” and “Age group”.\n\n3. **Category Combinations**: This is a combination of multiple categories together. For instance, we might assign both the \"Gender\" and \"Age Group\" categories to a category combination called \"Age/Gender\".\n\n4. **Category Option Combinations**: These result from all possible combinations of all category options within a category combination. In the example above, the following category option combinations would be created: \"Female/<5 years\", \"Female/>5 years\", \"Male/<5 years\", \"Male/>5 years\".\n\nIt's important to note that the category model is completely independent of the data element model. Data elements are loosely coupled to categories, in that the association between them can be changed at any time without losing any data. However, it is generally not recommended to change the association between data elements and their category combinations trivially or often because of potential incompatibility between data which has been collected using differing category combinations.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [DHIS2 documentation on Data Elements and Custom Dimensions](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/database-design/aggregate-system-design/data-elements-and-custom-dimensions.html#categories)."

      "answer": "In machine learning, the dataset is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and test sets. \n\n1. **Training Set**: This is the largest portion of your dataset and is used to train your model. It's recommended to allocate 70% of your dataset to the training set. The model learns from this data and formulates a prediction function based on the loss function, which informs the model how close or far away it is from making the correct prediction. However, there's a risk of overfitting where the model learns an overly specific function that performs well on your training data, but does not generalize to images it has never seen [[source]](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split#what-is-the-training-dataset).\n\n2. **Validation Set**: This is a separate section of your dataset used during training to get a sense of how well your model is doing on images that are not being used in training. It's common to report validation metrics continually after each training epoch. These metrics help to understand when your model has hit the best performance it can reach on your validation set. It's recommended to hold out 20% of your dataset for the validation set [[source]](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split#what-is-the-validation-dataset).\n\n3. **Test Set**: This set contains images that were kept out of the training stage. The result on the test set is a good indicator for the strength of the model. It's used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and to check if the model has overfitted the training data. It's recommended to hold out 10% of your dataset for the test set [[source]](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split-with-roboflow).\n\nIn the context of Roboflow, when uploading images, users are prompted to create a train, valid, and test split to encourage model building best practices [[source]](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split-with-roboflow)."

      "answer": "In distributed databases like Milvus and Zilliz Cloud, consistency ensures that every node or replica offers the same data view during read or write operations. Both Milvus and Zilliz Cloud provide three levels of consistency: Strong, Bounded Staleness, and Eventually. Here are the differences between these three levels:\n\n1. **Strong**: This is the strictest level of consistency. It ensures that users always read the most recent data version, offering the highest accuracy but may lead to increased latency. This level is best for functional testing and critical applications like online financial systems where data accuracy is paramount. In terms of the Guarantee Timestamp (GuaranteeTs), which is used to achieve these consistency levels, the Strong level matches the latest system timestamp, ensuring all data up to this point is visible before queries.\n\n2. **Bounded Staleness**: This level permits temporary data inconsistency but typically achieves global consistency after a short period. It offers a balance between latency and accuracy. Bounded staleness is suitable for systems like video recommendation platforms, where occasional data inconsistencies don't drastically affect performance. In terms of the GuaranteeTs, the Bounded Staleness level slightly predates the latest system timestamp, permitting queries on slightly older data.\n\n3. **Eventually**: This is the most relaxed level, allowing data to converge to a consistent state over time without strict read-write order. It maximizes search performance by sacrificing immediate consistency and therefore is best suitable for scenarios prioritizing speed over immediate data accuracy, such as displaying product reviews. In terms of the GuaranteeTs, the Eventually level sets a minimal value to bypass consistency checks, enabling immediate queries on available data.\n\nSources:\n- [Milvus Consistency Levels](https://milvus.io/docs/consistency.md#Consistency-levels)\n- [Zilliz Consistency Levels](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/consistency-level)\n- [Guarantee Timestamp for Consistency](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/byoc/consistency-level#leveraging-guarantee-timestamp-for-consistency)"

New syncs will overwrite all data in the destination table with a new copy of the source data. This means that data that has been removed from the source after an old sync will be deleted in the destination table. This approach has the advantage that data that has been deleted from the source will also be deleted in the destination. This is in contrast to incremental sync modes, for which this is not always the case. [source](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/full-data-synchronization#step-2)\n\n**Full Refresh Append**:\nIn this mode, all data in the source database is sent to the destination database, regardless of whether it has been synced before or not. However, new syncs will take all data from the most recent sync and append it to the raw destination table. If normalization is enabled, then records that have recently been appended to the raw table will be normalized and appended to the normalized table. This may be useful for historical report generation or for regulatory compliance. [source](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/full-data-synchronization#step-2)\n\nIn summary, the key difference between the two modes is how they handle existing data in the destination.

      "question": "what is the difference between a tenant and an application? ",
      "answer": "In the context of Basis Theory, a Tenant and an Application serve different purposes and have distinct roles.\n\nA **Tenant** in Basis Theory represents an isolated environment in which your Tokens and other resources are defined, managed, and stored. Data is not shared between Tenants, but you can create as many Tenants as you'd like within Basis Theory. You can use multiple Tenants to isolate different domains of data, and to support your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The user account that was used to create a Tenant will be designated as the Tenant Owner. New members can be invited to an existing Tenant, and managing Tenant Members can also be done directly through the API [[source](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-tenants)].\n\nOn the other hand, an **Application** in Basis Theory is used to interact with Tokens or Services (e.g. Proxy, Reactors) through the Basis Theory API using an API key that is issued to the Application. Access to your Tenant's data is limited by applying access controls to an Application via Permissions and Access Rules to ensure services and users only have access to the data they need. A common use-case for Applications is to grant minimal access to multiple systems where each system is only authorized to perform necessary operations and access a relevant subset of data within a Tenant [[source](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/concepts/access-controls)].\n\nIn summary, a Tenant is like a container for your data and resources, while an Application is a means to interact with that data and those resources in a controlled manner."

      "question": "what is the difference between the SummaryIndex and the DocumentSummaryIndex?",
      "answer": "The `SummaryIndex` and `DocumentSummaryIndex` are two different types of indices used in LlamaIndex.\n\nThe `SummaryIndex` is a simpler form of Index best suited to queries where you are trying to generate a summary of the text in your documents. It simply stores all of the documents and returns all of them to your query engine ([source](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/understanding/indexing/indexing.html)). It stores Nodes as a sequential chain and during query time, if no other query parameters are specified, LlamaIndex simply loads all Nodes in the list into the Response Synthesis module ([source](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/index_guide.html)).\n\nOn the other hand, the `DocumentSummaryIndex` extracts a summary from each document and stores that summary, as well as all nodes corresponding to the document. Retrieval can be performed through the LLM or embeddings. The relevant documents to the query are selected based on their summaries and all retrieved nodes corresponding to the selected documents are retrieved ([source](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.html), [source](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.ipynb)).\n\nHere is an example of how to build a `DocumentSummaryIndex`:\n\n```python\n# LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo)\nchatgpt = OpenAI(temperature=0, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\nsplitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024)\n\n# default mode of building the index\nresponse_synthesizer = get_response_synthesizer(\n    response_mode=\"tree_summarize\", use_async=True\n)\ndoc_summary_index = DocumentSummaryIndex.from_documents(\n    city_docs,\n    llm=chatgpt,\n    transformations=[splitter],\n    response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer,\n    show_progress=True,\n)\n```\n([source](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.html), [source](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.ipynb)).\n\nIn summary, the main difference between the two is that the `SummaryIndex` returns all documents to your query engine, while the `DocumentSummaryIndex` extracts and stores a summary from each document, and retrieves nodes based on these summaries."

      "answer": "Hmm, I don't know enough to give you a confident answer yet. However, I can tell you that both `Activity.onCreate()` and `Application.onCreate()` are lifecycle methods in Android development. They are called at different points in the lifecycle of an Android app and serve different purposes. \n\nFor more specific details about these methods and their differences, I would recommend referring to the official Android documentation or other reliable resources on Android development."

      "question": "What's the difference between self-managed and cloud?",
      "answer": "Camunda offers two main deployment options: SaaS (Software as a Service) and Self-Managed.\n\n**Camunda SaaS** is a cloud-based service where Camunda handles the management of the resources needed for the performance and throughput of the platform. This includes the deployment of the Zeebe broker, an elastic database for Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize, and the Java applications for Optimize, Operate, and Tasklist. This option provides peace of mind as Camunda does the heavy lifting and provides everything as a service for you, allowing you to concentrate on your important work. In the SaaS version, you also have the web modeler, which is integrated with the broker clusters, and the Cloud Console, which allows you to provision clusters and create API credentials for client applications, either via the UI or via a REST API[^1^][^2^].\n\n**Camunda Self-Managed** is an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, where you host it yourself. This setup is highly customizable and can be deployed in different setups. The components available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed include Zeebe, Zeebe Gateway, Operate, Tasklist, Connectors, Optimize, Identity (not available in Camunda 8 SaaS), and Web Modeler (Enterprise only). Users may also use Desktop Modeler as an addition to these components. For deployment, Helm/Kubernetes is the recommended method, especially in production[^1^][^3^].\n\nIn terms of setup and user experience, there might be some differences. The setup is expected to be easier on the cloud due to a different degree of flexibility. However, the cloud version might have a bit less functionality as it's still being built out[^4^].\n\nFor development usage in Camunda 8 Self-Managed, it's recommended to use Helm charts on KIND if SaaS provided by Camunda is not an option[^5^].\n\n[^1^]: [Support QA Part 1](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/conceptual-differences#camunda-deployment)\n[^2^]: [Camunda Community Podcast > 454051 > Top Eight Questions about Camunda Platform 8 Part 13](https://camundacommunitypodcast.buzzsprout.com/454051/10860329-top-eight-questions-about-camunda-platform-8)\n[^3^]: [Docs > Self-managed > Camunda 8 Self-Managed](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/about-self-managed)\n[^4^]: [Camunda Community Podcast > 454051 > Optimize with Eric Lundberg Part 8](https://camundacommunitypodcast.buzzsprout.com/454051/10286049-optimize-with-eric-lundberg)\n[^5^]: [Docs > Self-managed > Platform-deployment > Camunda 8 installation overview > Deployment recommendation > Development](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/overview#development)"

      "question": "What is the difference between the 'migrate dev' and 'db push' commands?",
      "answer": "The `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma db push` commands are both used for evolving your database schema during development, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors.\n\nThe `prisma migrate dev` command is used for creating an SQL migration based on changes in the Prisma schema, applying it, and generating Prisma Client. This command is intended for use when you're comfortable with the changes to your database schema and want to persist them in a migration file. The `migrate dev` command also requires a shadow database and is not supported on MongoDB. Here's an example of how it's used:\n\n```bash\nprisma migrate dev\n```\n\nOn the other hand, the `prisma db push` command is used for quickly prototyping your database schema. It creates the database schema based on the Prisma schema without any migrations. This command is useful when you want to quickly try out changes to your database schema without the need to persist these changes in a migration file. The `db push` command does not create a `_prisma_migrations` table and is recommended for use with MongoDB and PlanetScale. Here's an example of how it's used:\n\n```bash\nprisma db push\n```\n\nIn summary, you would use `prisma db push` for quick, iterative prototyping, and `prisma migrate dev` when you're ready to persist your changes in a migration file.\n\nSources:\n- [Prisma Blog](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-ga-b5eno5g08d0b#evolving-the-schema-in-development)\n- [Prisma GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/20523)\n- [Prisma Docs - Understanding Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/overview)\n- [Prisma Docs - Prisma Migrate CLI Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#migrate-dev)\n- [Prisma Docs - Prototyping Your Schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema)\n- [Prisma Docs - Mental Model](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/mental-model#prototype-your-schema)"

      "question": "which permissions in LC are able to request waivers vs create waivers",
      "answer": "In Sonatype, the ability to add waivers is limited based on the permissions included in the user's role. The \"Waive Policy Violations\" permission is needed to add waivers. Users without this permission have the option to request a waiver by sharing an API call with a user who has the correct permissions[^1^].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the user must have the ability to \"Edit IQ Elements\" to be able to create waivers[^2^][^3^][^4^][^5^]. The default roles which have this are \"Policy Administrator\" and Organization \"Owner\". Alternatively, the user can create a custom role with this privilege[^2^][^3^][^4^][^5^].\n\nAs for requesting a waiver, the documentation suggests that the request option exists due to a lack of permissions[^6^]. However, it's not explicitly stated what permissions are needed to \"request\" a waiver.\n\nPlease refer to the official Sonatype documentation for more details on waiver permissions[^1^] and role management[^2^][^3^][^4^][^5^].\n\n[^1^]: (Source: https://help.sonatype.com/en/waiver-tasks.html)\n[^2^]: (Source: https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/84507)\n[^3^]: (Source: https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/77228)\n[^4^]: (Source: https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/70729)\n[^5^]: (Source: https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/77823)\n[^6^]: (Source: https://sonatype.zendesk.com/tickets/71029)"
